The personal reflective
memo is a two-page document

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120
that I ask the students to
write at the end of the class

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.700
but before the oral exam.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.020
So all the lectures we've
had, all the team assignments,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.600
and all the material
has been presented.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.390
And at this point,
this reflective memo

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.910
asks the students to think
back on the material.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.540
What really was the most
important thing they learned?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.340
What of what they
learned in the class

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.900
are they going to build into
their own future projects,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.710
their own careers?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.010
If they're interested in systems
engineering as a career choice,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.670
whether it's in research or in
industry, why is that the case?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.820
And so they submit this one or
two days before the oral exam,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.420
and so we have a chance to
read those reflective memos.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.910
And usually, one of the
very first questions

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.060
in the oral exam is
about some key ideas

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.099
that they presented
in their oral memo,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.380
so it provides a great
hook into the oral exam.
