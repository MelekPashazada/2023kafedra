OLIVER DE WECK:
Concept questions

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,740
are a fairly recent
instrument for checking

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,430
the understanding of students
in real time during the class.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,500
One way to administer
concept questions

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,570
is using clicker systems.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,640
They've been around
for several years.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,390
A concept question is
typically a very short question

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,600
that requires either
reflection, or some very simple

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,940
calculation, that can be
done in less than a minute.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,130
The concept question is intended
to surface misconceptions,

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,040
but also alignment
and understanding.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,920
And I do administer the
concept questions using,

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,230
in this case, Google Forms.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,110
But there's other ways to
do it, essentially providing

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,120
the students a very short URL--

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,250
a link that they can enter
either on their laptops, even

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,770
on their smartphones
or on their tablets.

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,460
And usually, a concept question
is a multiple choice question.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,080
Sometimes, it's very easy.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,240
Sometimes, it's quite tricky.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,150
And I give the students
about 30 seconds

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,100
or so to think about it, work
out an answer, respond online.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,640
And then, once the
answer period is over,

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,390
I display the
responses in real time.

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,420
And what's nice about it,
in the context of a SPOC,

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,520
it doesn't matter
where the students sit,

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
whether they're with
you in the classroom,

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,400
whether they're online.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,990
Everybody has the same link.

30
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,810
So you're getting everybody's
responses at the same time.

31
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,620
So it's a great
mechanism for engagement.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,330
Sometimes, everybody agrees--

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,520
100% or 90% agreement.

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,590
Everybody chose
the right answer.

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,560
And in that case, there's
not much discussion needed.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,080
Because it's clear
that it clicked.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,120
You know the concept
is well understood.

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
My favorite concept
questions are

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,430
the ones where the answers
are all over the map.

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,650
You have five possible
choices, and each of them

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,650
got close to 20%.

42
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,250
That's great, because now, you
have a hook for discussion.

43
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,550
So I would then,
if that happens.

44
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,890
spend the next three,
four, five minutes

45
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,620
in the class
reiterating the concept,

46
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,380
and then asking students,
who voted for A?

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,490
Who voted for B?

48
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,660
Why did you do that?

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,370
What was your opinion?

50
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,590
And so you get a great
discussion going,

51
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,110
which, again, can have
the in-classroom, and then

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,040
the online component, as well.

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,840
We also use the chat during
those post-concept questions.

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,890
And it's a great
way to activate it.

55
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,150
And there's a
second reason I also

56
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,940
do concept questions,
at least one

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,740
during lecture, which is, it's
a great way to track attendance.

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,280
And I'm up front with
the students about this.

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,940
Because you can see the time
tag when students responded.

60
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,790
So you know exactly who
responded to the chat

61
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,110
during the class.

62
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,120
And I do use that for
participation grading.
