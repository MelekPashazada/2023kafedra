OLIVIER de Weck: About
five years ago, we

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.510
started thinking about our
classes in the area of aircraft

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.630
systems and spacecraft
systems in the department.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.220
And we started
realizing that there

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.620
was a particular class
that we didn't have,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.350
and something that seemed
very important to us,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.810
and also very important
to people in industry.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.730
And that is a
general introduction

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.950
to systems engineering.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.490
Systems engineering is
essentially the art and science

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.100
of coordinating and
putting together

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.230
the different
disciplines in order

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.000
to create safe, efficient
flying systems--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.830
not just flying systems,
but systems in general.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.910
And so we decided to create
a six-unit class, which

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.920
is a half class,
that would focus

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.610
on the methodology
and the processes

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.900
in systems engineering,
which is going all

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.780
the way from stakeholder
needs and expectations,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.550
all the way to a
functioning system that

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.230
can be deployed in the field.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.490
This class, 16842, is really
a door-opener to the world

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.080
of systems engineering.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.320
And what we use in the
class to orient everybody

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.330
is the classic V-model
of systems engineering.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.500
Now what is the V-model?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.310
The V-model takes you
step-by-step through the life

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.890
cycle of a system, starting
with the left side of the V,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.790
which is, why should the system
exist in the first place?

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.050
Who are the stakeholders?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.880
What are their expectations?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260
How do you formulate a concept
of operations for a system?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.500
And then go step-by-step
through the V,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.750
through the requirements
definition, concept generation

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.990
and selection, driving the
system design, all the way

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.920
to the details, to every little
part, and piece, and component,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.300
and then moving
up the right side

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.940
of the V, where you
integrate all these pieces

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.610
into subsystems and modules.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.790
You do verification,
validation, testing.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000
You commission the system
and bring it into operations.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.620
And even then, the
job isn't done.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.800
You have to accompany the
system throughout its life cycle

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.740
through maintenance,
upgrades, repair,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.750
making sure the system
is really operating

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.710
as efficiently as it can.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.150
So what the class does is
take students systematically

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.940
through every portion of the
V, so that at the end of it,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
they have a good overview over,
what is systems engineering?

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.067
And what are the key steps in
the life cycle of a system?
