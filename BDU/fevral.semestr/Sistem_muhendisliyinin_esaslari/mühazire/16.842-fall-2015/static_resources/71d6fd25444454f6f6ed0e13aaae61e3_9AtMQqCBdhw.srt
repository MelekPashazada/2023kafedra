8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,360
OLIVIER DE WECK: So let's get
going on system integration

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,590
and interface management.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,075
So we're essentially moving
up the right side of the V.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,300
And the idea is all the
details have been designed.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,090
The concept has been selected.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,850
We know what we're doing, but
now we have to re-integrate

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,930
the system and make
sure it works--

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,260
it performs the functions
that are intended

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,780
and satisfies the requirements.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,730
And so what I'm going to
cover today is three things.

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,660
First of all, why do we care?

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
Why is interface
management important?

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,330
Why is it important?

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,840
There's two main reasons.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,190
One is because a lot
of failures originate--

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,200
so a lot of failures
originate at interfaces.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960
And the other reason
is because in order

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,240
to design and manufacture
a lot of systems,

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,810
we need to work with
partners and suppliers.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,540
And I'll talk about interface
management, sort of the details

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,600
of it, the types of interfaces.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,570
I'll Introduce the DSM, the
Design Structure Matrix,

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,980
as an important method.

31
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,250
And then we'll talk about ICDs,
Interface Control Documents.

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,630
They're a very big
deal in practice.

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,900
And then finally, I'll talk
about system integration--

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,840
in particular, the sequence
which you integrate systems,

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
and then the role of standards.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,890
All right, so here, the point
that I want to make here

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,870
is when you talk
about interfaces,

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,840
the first thing you need
to be clear is, is it

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,370
an internal interface
or an external interface

40
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,650
of the system?

41
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,860
And so I think you remember
this chart here that has--

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,650
is this you guys--

43
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,550
that has a system
boundary that's defined.

44
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,260
So the system
boundary, in this case,

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,530
we have this
digital camera here.

46
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,220
And the internal interfaces
are essentially the interfaces

47
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,860
that are within this boundary.

48
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,500
So those are internal
interfaces within the camera,

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,650
within the peripherals, that
are included in the system

50
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,710
boundary.

51
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,560
And then we have
external interfaces,

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,250
which would be the interfaces
between the system boundary

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,020
and anything that's
on the outside

54
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,120
that you don't design
or control directly.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,650
So that's an
important distinction.

56
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,250
The next point I want
to make is that you

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,170
have to really carefully think
about interfaces as seeds

58
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,480
of potential system failures.

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,930
And so I have three
examples here for you.

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,110
So the first one is--

61
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,390
this is actually--

62
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,060
Katya, sorry, this is
from Russia, from 2007.

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,620
This is traffic.

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,115
This is one of the big--

65
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:05,830
not [RUSSIAN],, but
prospekt, the six lanes

66
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,750
or eight lanes on
one side, and there's

67
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,880
a crossroad coming in here.

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,010
This is a traffic intersection.

69
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,660
And you can see
traffic is completely

70
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,500
blocked on this side.

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,180
So traffic engineers think
a lot about interfaces,

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,140
which are mainly your
intersections, the roundabouts.

73
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,980
Interfaces are really where a
traffic system makes or breaks

74
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,400
the traffic system.

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,380
So that's a bottleneck.

76
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,380
An interface is a
bottleneck, basically.

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,390
The second example here
in the middle, this

78
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,590
is actually an example from
MIT from an undergraduate class

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,330
in design where the students
were designing an airfoil.

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,080
So this has been produced
with a foam cutter.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,550
And you have a spar
that goes through here.

82
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,690
And this was intended for
the MIT Formula SAE race car

83
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,080
to create downward
pressure on the rear axle.

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,690
They tested it in
the wind tunnel,

85
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,670
and it worked well at 20 miles
per hour, 40 miles per hour.

86
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,290
And then at 60 miles per
hour, there was a failure,

87
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,620
and the airfoil just
basically disintegrated

88
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,720
and was carried off
into the wind tunnel

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,060
and completely shredded
by the propeller.

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,480
Why did that happen?

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,830
Well, they thought
about the shear loads.

92
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,329
So when you have
an airfoil, there's

93
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,710
a force that's acting
orthogonally to the airfoil.

94
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,520
So they thought about that.

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,710
The problem is there's also a
torque, like a pitching moment,

96
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,300
a torque that's generated.

97
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,750
And the higher the air speed
is, the higher the torque.

98
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,820
They didn't think-- there
was no real good way

99
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,680
to react against the torque
that was being generated.

100
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,450
So at that high speed, the
airfoil, all of a sudden,

101
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,790
tilted and created a lot of drag
and basically was destroyed.

102
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,740
So the airfoil itself was OK,
but the interface was not.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,570
The third example here is a
software example or a software

104
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,580
interface, very famous.

105
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,760
This was the launch
failure of the Ariane 501.

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,760
The very first launch
of the Ariane 5

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,330
basically led to an
auto-destruct of the rocket

108
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,710
upon ascent.

109
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,920
There was an accident
investigation.

110
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,160
And I'm just quoting you here
from the key passage, which

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,470
said that "the active initial
reference system transmitted

112
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,280
essentially diagnostic
information to the launcher's

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,780
main computer."

114
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,480
And so the main computer was
interpreting this information

115
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,110
as though the rocket has
gone off course and trying

116
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,840
to correct for it when,
in fact, it hadn't.

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,140
It was actually physically going
exactly the right trajectory,

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,620
but it was misinterpreted.

119
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,200
And this is also a very famous
failure due to software reuse.

120
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,610
So three examples of
interfaces-- bottlenecks

121
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,970
in traffic, structural
failures, and erroneous function

122
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,740
calls in software.

123
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,920
And so be careful
about interfaces.

124
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,960
The second reason we care is
working with manufacturers

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,300
and suppliers.

126
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,620
So the picture
here is essentially

127
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,280
the Dreamliner, the Boeing 787.

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,250
And you can see here the
different colors essentially

129
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,870
represent the
different countries

130
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,140
or the different suppliers that
are providing different parts

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,670
of the airplane.

132
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,555
Now, does anybody-- let me
ask this question to MIT,

133
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:27,090
see if we can hear them now.

134
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,810
No?

135
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,270
Well, maybe we can use the chat.

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,540
What's different
between the Dreamliner--

137
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,000
and you could have seen
a similar picture, say,

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,300
for the 737 or prior
generation aircraft.

139
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,960
So what's the real difference
here with the interfaces,

140
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,785
with the 787?

141
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,960
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Composites is one thing, but
that's a structural thing.

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,770
I have something else in mind.

145
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,390
There's some other fundamental
change that was made in the 787

146
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,500
beyond composites.

147
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

148
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:09,882
OLIVIER DE WECK: Nope.

149
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:13,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

150
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,140
OLIVIER DE WECK: This has to
do with the way the airplane is

151
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,272
assembled, with assembly.

152
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

153
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,760
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yes, yes, exactly.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,620
So the supply chain
is very different.

155
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620
And I guess I lost my--

156
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,270
hm, did I reverse this?

157
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:45,360
So the point I want to
make is that in the 787,

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,530
the modules are
essentially pre-outfitted.

159
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,500
Like, all the systems,
like the electrical system,

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,700
the hydraulics, everything
is already installed

161
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,520
by the time the module
arrives at the assembly

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,610
plant in Everett and
close to Seattle.

163
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,340
Before, you got the
structural sections, but then

164
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,390
all the electricals, all
the inside was done on site.

165
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,840
So the modules are pre-outfitted
with all the subsystems.

166
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,590
And the final assembly itself
is very short, only a few days.

167
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,920
So a big, big step, and
that's exactly right.

168
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,690
That's the supply chain impact.

169
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,480
OK, so then the
final point here is

170
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,980
this is essentially
a launch vehicle

171
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,690
design, a launch
vehicle that's being

172
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,944
designed at NASA, the SLS.

173
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,610
And if you think about
a launch vehicle,

174
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,450
you have the first stage, second
stage, third stage, payload,

175
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,522
the fairing.

176
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:40,990
Actually, a lot
of these fairings

177
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,390
are made here in Switzerland.

178
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,770
And defining these
interfaces very clearly

179
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,420
is critical to
reduce complexity.

180
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,190
Understanding the
different types, which

181
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,160
we're going to get into next--

182
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,280
identifying the interfaces
is a way to reduce risk.

183
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,470
And I just talked
about these problems

184
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,720
originating at interfaces.

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,570
And so hopefully,
it's pretty clear now

186
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,410
that this is a critical issue.

187
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,070
So what I'd like to
do now-- and we'll

188
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,830
try to troubleshoot the audio
issues in the meantime--

189
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,310
is for you to turn to
your partner exercise

190
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,490
and share with
each other, what is

191
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,530
an instance in your
past experience,

192
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,340
maybe during an internship or
in a project that you worked on,

193
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,360
where interface definition
and management was critical?

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,630
AUDIENCE: Some of us went this
summer to Russia, to Moscow,

195
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,380
to follow a summer camp on
system engineering and space

196
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,420
engineering.

197
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,960
And we had a project
there where we

198
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,110
had to design a
mission to deep space.

199
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,750
And everyone was
assigned to a group.

200
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,200
The groups were around
five to seven people,

201
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,630
and there were five
to seven groups.

202
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,800
And each group had a
subsystem to design,

203
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,740
but no group was assigned
to system engineering.

204
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,990
So actually, there was
no one to make sure

205
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,590
that all the interfaces were OK.

206
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,580
So we had to go to
each other group

207
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,840
and ask for the interfaces.

208
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,020
And then when we had to
go back, it was a mess.

209
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,985
And at the end, every
group had something good.

210
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:19,910
But when we tried to put
all the systems together,

211
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,270
it was a big mess and
nothing was working.

212
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,510
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's a
pitch for systems engineering.

213
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,850
So that's a good point.

214
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,055
So even if you negotiate
bilateral interfaces

215
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,560
amongst subsystems,
there's no guarantee

216
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,110
that it will work
at the system level.

217
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,750
OK, can we get from MIT?

218
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,227
Can somebody give us
what you discussed?

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,830
AUDIENCE: Is this
the mic working?

220
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,620
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah,
now we can hear you.

221
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,380
AUDIENCE: Great.

222
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,680
So my grad school
project here at MIT

223
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,220
is a secondary payload
on a big NASA mission.

224
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,605
And as a secondary payload,
the interface control

225
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,020
is a really big deal.

226
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,659
So we're getting
all of our power

227
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,700
and all of our communication
from the spacecraft,

228
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,300
and we're also getting a
heater circuit from them.

229
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,042
So any change is a big deal.

230
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,500
We had to change
our heater circuit

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,291
and we had to go through
a lot of paperwork

232
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,860
just to splice a wire.

233
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,300
So no issue with it, but it's
not as easy as it sounds,

234
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,010
and there's a lot of control
over it, I would say.

235
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,960
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, maybe
another example from MIT.

236
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,109
Somebody else?

237
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,150
AUDIENCE: Does this work?

238
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,671
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

239
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,420
AUDIENCE: So the--

240
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,753
OLIVIER DE WECK: We've got
it fixed out now, by the way.

241
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,575
I think this is all
working now, so good.

242
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,200
AUDIENCE: The last
project I was a part

243
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,870
of was building an aircraft
for a Red Bull Flugtag.

244
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,620
So it was like a giant glider
that we'd push off a platform.

245
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,760
But we were kind of
building it in a hurry.

246
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
The time constraints
were pretty quick,

247
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,280
and we didn't really
have all the requirements

248
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,320
until a month or two
before the competition.

249
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,470
So we winged a lot of the
design and construction.

250
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,770
And so we thought about
how to build the wing

251
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,960
and how to build the empennage
and how to build the cockpit,

252
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,750
but we didn't think about
how to put them all together.

253
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,800
And so it turned out just being
wrapped with a lot of carbon

254
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,290
fiber and epoxied.

255
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,280
And in some cases, we used wood.

256
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,670
And it was a very heavy and
poor-looking assembly once all

257
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,510
that was together.

258
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,340
Even though each part
individually looked great,

259
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,280
they didn't really come
together perfectly.

260
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,160
So we'll change that next year,
but could have thought more.

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,590
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

262
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,240
Great example.

263
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,580
All right, so
hopefully, this is sort

264
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,840
of motivation that, in
a sense, a system is

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,582
the functions you want, the
components, and the interfaces.

266
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:08,790
You've got to have all three.

267
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,260
If you only have
great components

268
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,360
but you don't understand
the interfaces,

269
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,550
you stick them together, I'm not
sure what you're going to get.

270
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,661
Yes, do you want to--

271
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:23,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Is it
also important the interfaces

272
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,384
with testing facilities?

273
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:27,800
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, absolutely.

274
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,790
So testability requirements,
how you're going to test it,

275
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,730
is critical.

276
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,890
Also, ground support
equipment-- you know,

277
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,980
like maintenance equipment.

278
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,300
So not just the
interfaces, the system

279
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,540
when you're operating
it, but during testing,

280
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,010
during maintenance.

281
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,700
And those are often forgotten
as well, so great point.

282
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,550
So let's keep moving here.

283
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,520
I want to talk about
the types of interfaces,

284
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,280
and then we'll get to DSM.

285
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,350
So here's a set of examples of
interfaces that we encounter.

286
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,410
Let's see if we can get
the slides back up here.

287
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,860
So essentially,
here's some examples.

288
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,250
In the upper left, we
have a valve, and then

289
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,320
a tank on the right side.

290
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,110
And we essentially
have mass flow

291
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,290
from the valve to the
tank, and m dot, dm dt.

292
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,310
We have a rocket.

293
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,920
If you think about the rocket
interface with the payload,

294
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,510
it's transferring
momentum, right?

295
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,660
The rocket provides
thrust, force F,

296
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,150
for some amount
of time, delta-t,

297
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,580
and that's the
momentum imparted.

298
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,170
We have a heat
exchanger that is maybe

299
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,110
giving heat off to the
air, the surrounding air.

300
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,978
So we have a heat flux, q dot.

301
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:51,690
We have solar cells,
PV cells, that

302
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,950
are producing electrical
power, voltage times current.

303
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,700
And this power flux is being
sent to a battery where

304
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,420
the energy is stored.

305
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,914
So these are all pretty
obvious examples.

306
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,330
And then on the
right side, things

307
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,830
get maybe a little
bit less obvious.

308
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,060
You go to a URL and you download
an HTML file into your browser.

309
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,990
That's an information.

310
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,150
You're getting data.

311
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,390
You have a motion sensor
attached, say, to your house,

312
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,190
and it triggers an alarm.

313
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,210
That's a command,
different from data.

314
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,700
NPR is National Public Radio.

315
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,470
This is kind of the high-quality
radio news reporting.

316
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,360
And you listen to this.

317
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,670
So there's a
cognitive interface.

318
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:45,160
And then if any of you
have had any psychotherapy,

319
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,210
this is also an interface
between the patient

320
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,320
and the psychotherapist.

321
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,630
This is an effective interface.

322
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,680
So these are very different.

323
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,590
And you can say,
well, there's hundreds

324
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,670
of types of interfaces.

325
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,130
Well, no.

326
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,520
The argument here
is all interfaces

327
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,210
can be reduced or described
by these four canonical types.

328
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,090
The first one is
physical connection.

329
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,125
So A connects to
B. B connects to A.

330
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,570
A physical connection
typically implies

331
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,260
that there's a
force or torque that

332
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,380
can be transmitted
across the interface,

333
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,490
and it's always symmetrical.

334
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,220
And then we have energy,
mass, and information flows.

335
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,130
And I'll give you
some examples of each

336
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,810
of these types of interfaces.

337
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,630
And these energy, mass
and information flows

338
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,310
typically are asymmetric.

339
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,740
It flows from one to the other.

340
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,120
Physical connection
is always symmetric.

341
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,660
So let's go through these,
and I'll give you examples.

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,560
And then we'll see
what can we do with it.

343
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,440
So here's physical
connection examples--

344
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,370
rollers, brake pads.

345
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:59,260
A finger touching a touch
screen is a physical interface.

346
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,670
The interface can be reversible.

347
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,339
In other words, the
connection is temporary--

348
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,950
and examples of that would
be electrical connectors,

349
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,890
USB ports, latch
mechanisms, nuts and bolts--

350
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,839
or permanently connected,
such as in-- so one of you

351
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,099
mentioned riveting,
spot welding, fusing.

352
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,349
And a fun question
that comes up,

353
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,240
well, I'm a software engineer.

354
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
What is physical connection
mean for software?

355
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,250
Well, it's a kind
of tricky question.

356
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,870
I think the closest analog
we have is compiling.

357
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,510
If you have pieces
of source code

358
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,660
and you compile your
program, then you've

359
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,100
essentially fused this together
into something new, right?

360
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,660
So I'll show you the example.

361
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,420
So how do we describe it?

362
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,550
Well, here's an OPM model of--

363
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,740
I'll give you a couple
examples from xerography.

364
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,530
So we have a main
motor here, number one,

365
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,460
and then two different clutches,
number two and number three.

366
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,070
And the process linking
them is engaging, right?

367
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,890
The main motor engages
through the clutch.

368
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,650
We can hide the
process, and then

369
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,380
we just have this bi-directional
interface between one and two

370
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,750
and one and three.

371
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,260
And then if we show this
as a mini-DSM here, one

372
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,960
connected to two, one
connected to three,

373
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,690
but two and three do not connect
directly with each other.

374
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,190
They don't have a direct
physical interface.

375
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,770
And you can see that because
those cells are empty.

376
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,820
So physical connection
implies symmetry

377
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,700
in the design structure
matrix that we can build up.

378
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,736
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

379
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:34,787
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

380
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:35,870
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, DSM--

381
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,450
so DSM means Design
Structure Matrix.

382
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,410
And I will introduce
that in a minute.

383
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,950
We've briefly mentioned
it before in the class,

384
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,500
but I'll get into
it in some detail.

385
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,780
Here's some more
picture examples

386
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,490
of physical connections--

387
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,370
so a welding joint,
irreversible, reversible, nuts

388
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,360
and bolts, RJ45, an
electrical connector.

389
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,470
And then here's your--

390
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,000
hey, I'm an old guy.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
I learned Fortran.

392
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,245
Well, Basic was my first
language, and then Fortran.

393
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,820
I did a lot of Fortran.

394
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,960
You guys probably don't
even know what that is.

395
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,380
But Fortran--
right, [INAUDIBLE]??

396
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,840
Fortran's kind of a big
deal still in some--

397
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

398
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,860
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

399
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,610
So basically the way this works
is you have your source code,

400
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,140
which are .f files.

401
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,370
These are basically
Ascii files, right?

402
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,430
And then first, you transform
them into binary files,

403
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,960
object files.

404
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,810
And then these get merged
together into an executable.

405
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,370
So that's the
process of compiling.

406
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,820
Any questions about
physical connections,

407
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,170
this type of interface,
physical connection?

408
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,430
Is it clear?

409
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,680
OK, any questions at MIT?

410
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,870
Can you still hear me?

411
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,647
AUDIENCE: Yes, we're good.

412
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:58,730
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

413
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,130
So let's move on
to energy flows.

414
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,690
Energy flows are present when
there's a net exchange of work

415
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,400
between two components.

416
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,720
So power is flowing across
the interface dw dt, right--

417
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,710
joules per second, watts.

418
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,530
And the energy, this energy
flow, this power flow,

419
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,270
can take different forms--

420
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,880
electrical power, which is
very common in many products.

421
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,940
And so the electrical
power usually

422
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,410
comes either as DC, Direct
Current, or AC, Alternating

423
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,620
Current.

424
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,460
And if you know a little
bit about the history

425
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,270
of electrical systems and
networks, there was a huge war.

426
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,310
It's called the AC/DC wars.

427
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,390
It's not the band.

428
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,740
This is not the rock music.

429
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,800
This is the war
between Edison, who

430
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,860
is a big proponent
of direct current,

431
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,790
and Tesla and Westinghouse,
who were really pushing

432
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,820
AC for big power distribution.

433
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,200
So we won in the end?

434
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
AC won.

435
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,535
It looked initially
like Edison was really--

436
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,035
and there's still,
in New York City,

437
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:06,350
there, for a long
time, and other places,

438
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,540
you still had DC power systems.

439
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,770
The problem with
DC power is there's

440
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,960
huge losses with distance.

441
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,020
And with AC, you can go
to very high voltages

442
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,840
and transmit power with
relatively little loss

443
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,220
over large distance.

444
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,090
That's the main reason that
AC won out, essentially.

445
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,430
The thing that's important
here-- and power, of course,

446
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,560
is current times voltage.

447
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,420
The thing that's important is
that these voltage levels--

448
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,540
and in the case of AC
power also, the frequency

449
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,420
is very important,
50 or 60 hertz.

450
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,640
This is very standardized, OK?

451
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,130
So if you're going to design a
satellite system, or a rover,

452
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,930
or an automotive system, or a
medical device or a consumer

453
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:58,190
product, the voltage
levels are pretty--

454
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,380
there's a few choices,
but you can't just

455
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,590
choose some arbitrary number,
because your whole industry,

456
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,500
your batteries, your
connectors, everything is now

457
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,420
pretty standardized.

458
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,870
So for the Octanus 1,
Rafael, what did you guys

459
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,490
choose for your power system?

460
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,882
What's your--

461
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 3.3 volts.

462
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,900
OLIVIER DE WECK:
3.3-volt bus across, OK.

463
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,300
And then if you
need more energy,

464
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,240
you just have to add batteries.

465
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,050
But that will
essentially-- and you

466
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,970
can do transformations as well.

467
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,350
You can have different
voltage levels in your system,

468
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,980
but that adds to the complexity.

469
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,100
Thermal flux is essentially
heat flux, dq dt.

470
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,330
There are three fundamental
mechanisms of heat transfer--

471
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,520
conduction, convection,
and radiation.

472
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,210
In spacecraft, radiation is
probably the most important

473
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,270
because that's the
only way to get rid

474
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,820
of heat out of your spacecraft.

475
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,130
And then you can do conduction
and convection internally.

476
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,360
RF power, so microwaves.

477
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,130
Transmitting or
transferring power

478
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,820
through microwaves is becoming--

479
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,850
of course, we now had microwave
ovens for a long time.

480
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,600
But even doing power beaming
over larger distances

481
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,610
with microwaves is
definitely something

482
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,380
that's been
demonstrated, and there's

483
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,450
a lot of interest in it.

484
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,880
Here also, we are pretty
standard frequencies, so

485
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,420
2.4 gigahertz, 5.8 gigahertz.

486
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,610
You have a whole industry
built around these standards.

487
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,270
By the way, why
the 2.4 gigahertz?

488
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,010
Let's see if-- at MIT.

489
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,147
This 2.4 gigahertz
for microwaves,

490
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,230
where does that come from?

491
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,350
Anybody know where
that comes from?

492
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,532
AUDIENCE: Is that the frequency
that can be transmitted easily

493
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,490
through the atmosphere?

494
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,460
OLIVIER DE WECK: Actually,
no, it's not good.

495
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,570
It's absorbed.

496
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,950
It's absorbed in the atmosphere.

497
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,440
It's the opposite.

498
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,250
This 2.4 is very
important because it's

499
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,530
a resonant frequency
of the water molecule.

500
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,811
So your microwave oven
will work at 2.4 gigahertz.

501
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:10,310
Why?

502
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,690
Because if you radiate
microwaves at that frequency,

503
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,510
it makes the water molecules
vibrate because that's

504
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,710
a resonant frequency, and
you transfer a lot of heat

505
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,920
or a lot of energy into
your water molecules, which

506
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,850
are the majority of your food.

507
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,330
So it's actually
really bad for--

508
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,470
you'd like to use 2.4
gigahertz, but if you

509
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,160
try to use that frequency for
atmospheric power transfer,

510
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,510
you're right at
the resonant mode.

511
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,590
So if you have a high level
of humidity in the air,

512
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,450
you're going to lose
a lot of that power,

513
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,840
just heating the atmosphere up
and not transmitting the power.

514
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,430
Does that make sense?

515
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,717
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

516
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,550
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

517
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,880
And then another very popular
frequency is 5.8 gigahertz.

518
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,010
And then we can go to
X band, which is closer

519
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,020
to 8 gigahertz, et cetera.

520
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,790
But anyway, so this is
a kind of growing area

521
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,560
is microwave power transfer.

522
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,000
And then of course, the
more old-fashioned, perhaps,

523
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,660
but still very important
is mechanical power,

524
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,080
so transferring energy and power
through a mechanical interface.

525
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,010
So if it's linear, it's
force times velocity.

526
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,880
If it's rotary, it's torque
times the angular rate

527
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,950
of rotation.

528
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,500
And then finally, energy--

529
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,810
typically, if you want
to have energy flow,

530
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,690
it does imply that there's a
physical connection as well,

531
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,810
like some kind of wires or a
gearbox or something like this.

532
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:43,810
However, a lot of interest now
in wireless power transfer.

533
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,050
But it's still kind of a--

534
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,020
for it to really work
reliably at high power levels,

535
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,020
this is pretty immature
technology still.

536
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,660
So here's some examples of--

537
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,572
again, this is from xerography.

538
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,030
And you'll understand
why I'm using

539
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,700
these examples in a minute.

540
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,380
So we have a paper.

541
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,440
We have toner, unfused toner.

542
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,400
And we want to fuse
those two together.

543
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,230
We do this through a heat
roller and heat and a belt.

544
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,730
And essentially,
we're transferring

545
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,880
energy from the heat
roll to the paper, which

546
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,920
allows it to fuse the toner.

547
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,400
So we have transfer of
energy from one to two,

548
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,170
which is shown by this
green mark here in the DSM.

549
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,920
So heat energy is transferred
from system one to system two.

550
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,900
One question that often
comes up is, well,

551
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,890
what if we have like waste heat?

552
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,720
There's heat losses, and
there's parasitic energy flows.

553
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,250
Do we care about those?

554
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,060
Do we represent those?

555
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,390
And the answer is
yes, you should,

556
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,400
especially if they
affect your performance

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,020
or your requirements.

558
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,520
So the first thing
you typically do,

559
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,280
as you map out your
interfaces, is you

560
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,530
map the flows that you want to
happen, that need to happen.

561
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,900
And then on top of
that, you map out

562
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,730
the flows that happen
even though you

563
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,630
didn't design for that, but
you need to account for them.

564
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,400
So heat losses would be an
example of that waste heat

565
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,030
flux.

566
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,310
Any questions about
energy or power flows?

567
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:31,010
MIT, any questions,
energy or power flux?

568
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,150
AUDIENCE: We're good, thanks.

569
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

570
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,640
Next one, mass flows.

571
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,760
Mass flows is when
matter, physical matter,

572
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,940
is being exchanged between
two elements or subsystems.

573
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,960
So mass flows is dm dt,
kilograms per second.

574
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,320
And the form of the matter
can be fluids, gases, solids.

575
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,800
I guess plasma as well.

576
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,725
There's a big plasma
center here on campus.

577
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,960
But the primary three are
fluids-- so if it's fluids,

578
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,630
it could be like a cooling
liquid, a refrigerant, fuel,

579
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,500
water.

580
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,560
If it's gases, air, exhaust gas.

581
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,120
And then for solids, examples
would be toner, paper.

582
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,900
If you're in the mining
industry, it's iron ore.

583
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,110
And typically, mass flow
implies an underlying

584
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,070
physical connection, like some
kind of channel or conduit.

585
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,760
So Rafael, your example of your
sucking up and melting the snow

586
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,070
and you said there's a hose, so
the hose is itself a component,

587
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,970
but it enables the mass
flow of the melted snow

588
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,910
into some holding
tank or reservoir.

589
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,589
And so the hose is the
physical connection.

590
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,380
And then the mass flow
that happens through

591
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,860
that hose is what's shown here.

592
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,690
Mass flows can be open.

593
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,120
So there's a source
and there's a sink.

594
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,100
The source and the sink could
be inside or outside your system

595
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,600
boundary.

596
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,670
You have to think about it.

597
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,270
But also, mass flows can form
continuous loops, particularly

598
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,220
if you recycle things.

599
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,380
Like for example,
in the refrigerator,

600
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,680
your cooling liquid continuously
cycles through your system.

601
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
So here's some
examples of mass flows.

602
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,250
We have a heat exchanger.

603
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,040
This is a U-type heat exchanger.

604
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,255
So on the top, we have what's
called here the shell side.

605
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:27,710
A fluid is coming in and
is running out on this end.

606
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,290
And then we have
horizontally, a fluid

607
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,180
that's coming in
on the lower side,

608
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,960
cycling through, exchanging
the heat, and moving out.

609
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,700
So a heat exchanger
is interesting

610
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,350
because what kind
of flows happen

611
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:48,160
in a heat exchanger of the
flows we've discussed so far?

612
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,680
Energy and mass flow, right?

613
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,450
So the two of them
happen together.

614
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,780
In order for the energy flow to
happen or transfer to happen,

615
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,980
the mass flow has
to happen as well.

616
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,160
So these two flows are
tied to each other.

617
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,810
Here's an example
from xerography.

618
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,510
So we have our
photoreceptor belt.

619
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,530
We have residual toner
on the photoreceptor

620
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,170
that needs to be removed
from the photoreceptor.

621
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,570
And we do this through a
cleaning lamp, and then

622
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,820
a blade.

623
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,330
So in this case, you
can show this as an OPM,

624
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,860
and then you can show it here
where that residual toner is

625
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,030
transferred from photoreceptor
one to the cleaning blade two.

626
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,300
And this is shown in the DSM
as a mass flow from one to two.

627
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,570
And then we have one more,
which is the information flows.

628
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,020
So this is really where
the big revolution

629
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,600
has happened in the
last two decades

630
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,110
since a lot of
functions that used

631
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,500
to be done mechanically have
been replaced with software.

632
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,940
And here's some examples
of these information flows.

633
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,760
So if your system has a
user interface, a GUI,

634
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,130
a graphical user interface, or
some kind of I/O, input/output,

635
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,480
with the user, that's critical.

636
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,970
That's an information interface.

637
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,590
And so Rafael, again coming
to your presentation--

638
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,780
so I'm going to pick
on you a lot today.

639
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,460
Not pick on you, but I'm
going to cite you a lot.

640
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,250
You said this rover is going to
be controlled somehow, right?

641
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,320
And the big question is
always, how much autonomy

642
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,620
do you put inside the
thing, and how much do you

643
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,990
rely on a user that's remote?

644
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,490
And that's clearly an
information interface.

645
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,490
The nature of the
information, is it analog?

646
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,420
Is it digital?

647
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,860
Is it wireless?

648
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,810
So on the analog side,
we're essentially

649
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,690
talking about some
signal, some voltage,

650
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,680
and there's been a lot
of work done on ADC,

651
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,840
analog-to-digital conversion.

652
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,410
And then the opposite
is digital to analog.

653
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,400
And depending on how many bits
you have available to you,

654
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,440
you're going to have some
discretization errors.

655
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,260
A purely digital interface,
we refer to it as DIO,

656
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,414
Digital Input/Output.

657
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:08,830
And then of course,
wireless, this

658
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,470
is the standard,
the 802.11 standard,

659
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,380
which is really very
important these days.

660
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,920
If you think about
why we need all this,

661
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,290
mainly, the main reason
is control, right?

662
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,920
We have sensors,
actuators, controllers.

663
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,370
And because this information
is never perfect--

664
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,450
there's gaps in the information
or there's noise superimposed--

665
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,900
we have to also filter and
amplify the information.

666
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,620
And so if you think about the
type of information flows--

667
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,111
for example, in spacecraft, we
could have telemetry, sensor

668
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:42,610
data.

669
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,650
And telemetry
fundamentally means,

670
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,450
I want to know how
is my system doing.

671
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,530
Is it healthy?

672
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,370
Are all the subsystems working?

673
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,730
Are there some anomalies?

674
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,630
Are components within
their temperature limits?

675
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,300
That's what we call telemetry.

676
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,120
And then commands are when
you are sending a command

677
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,800
to the system and say, you know,
turn this way, turn that way.

678
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,380
And fundamentally,
telemetry and commands

679
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,050
are treated quite differently.

680
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,750
So where do you need
better quality information?

681
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,820
Where is the link
more important,

682
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,890
on the telemetry side
or sending commands?

683
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,640
What do you think?

684
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,550
Actually, no.

685
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,100
So if your telemetry
is imperfect--

686
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,410
I mean, it depends a little
bit what you do with it.

687
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,710
But the commands are
typically more critical.

688
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,190
Like, if you have a
bit error in a command,

689
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,430
and it says fire
the engine but you

690
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,890
didn't want to fire the engine,
you can lose your mission.

691
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:47,100
So typically, what's
known as the bit error

692
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,650
rate has to be lower,
meaning the link budget is

693
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,300
much better for commands.

694
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,500
So there's an asymmetry.

695
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,070
OK, so here's some examples.

696
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,800
So here's a typical
control loop.

697
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,670
You have your plants, your
system, your actuator, sensors,

698
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,820
a comparator that compares
your reference signal--

699
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,060
this is how you want
the system to behave--

700
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,080
and sends that to a controller,
which then closes the loop.

701
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,090
The example here,
again from xerography,

702
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,580
is you have some
original document.

703
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,469
You want to make a copy here.

704
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:23,250
So there's a lamp that shines
light onto your document.

705
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,010
It goes through a
lens, a laser diode,

706
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,960
and then to your marking system.

707
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,770
The OPM, you have your
original, your optical system.

708
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,469
You create a digital
image file which then

709
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,330
is sent to the marking system.

710
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,980
So if we simplify
all this, we can

711
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,980
say there's information
flow from the optical system

712
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,449
to the marking system.

713
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,110
From one to two,
information is transferred.

714
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,669
So any questions?

715
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:52,020
So those are the four
fundamental types

716
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,659
of interfaces and
examples with that.

717
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,020
And so the theory, what the
theory of design tells us

718
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,880
is that this is universal.

719
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,260
Any kind of interface falls
into one of these types.

720
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,680
And in fact, even in
biological systems that's true.

721
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,419
Yeah?

722
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:10,375
AUDIENCE: When we have
a system [INAUDIBLE]??

723
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,910
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'll show
that to you in the DSM.

724
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,650
You actually track
them separately,

725
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,360
but they're within the same--

726
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,690
it's one big interface, but it
has these different subflows

727
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,510
within it, which means that--

728
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,730
it's not just the fact
that there is an interface,

729
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,470
but the complexity of the
interface is important.

730
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,560
So the most complex
interfaces obviously

731
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,410
would be the ones where you
have all four types, right?

732
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,040
It's a physical connection, and
there's an information flow,

733
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,900
and there's an energy
flow, and there's

734
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,330
a mass flow across
the interface.

735
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,420
Usually, it's only
a subset of those,

736
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,570
but you can have interfaces
where you have all these four

737
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,690
present at once.

738
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,075
Any questions about these
types of interfaces at MIT?

739
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:01,570
AUDIENCE: No, we're good.

740
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,410
Thank you.

741
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,840
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

742
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,760
In general, can you
hear better now?

743
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,870
Is it pretty stable over there?

744
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,388
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

745
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:13,000
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Good, all right.

746
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,430
So let me talk about DSM.

747
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,480
[INAUDIBLE] was
asking about DSM.

748
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,880
So DSM is a fairly recent
method, the last couple

749
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,450
of decades, for really
making a map of your system

750
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,910
that shows explicitly
these interfaces.

751
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,370
So here's a very simple example.

752
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,920
This is a sample system
with five components.

753
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,110
It has a pump, a controller,
a motor, a valve, a filter.

754
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,330
And in this case,
we have mass flow

755
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,560
from the pump through the
valve into the filter.

756
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,700
And so this block diagram
on the upper left,

757
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,130
the exact same information
is contained in this matrix.

758
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,460
So a DSM is always
a square matrix

759
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,400
where your components are
the rows and columns, equally

760
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,070
labeled.

761
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,420
And the diagonals here,
there's no information

762
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,120
on the diagonals.

763
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,360
So the component connects
with itself, obviously.

764
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,800
So you keep the
diagonals sort of blank.

765
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,980
And then all of those interfaces
and flows we mentioned

766
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,080
are shown as off-diagonals.

767
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,840
You have to be a little
careful because there's

768
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,260
two definitions of DSM depending
on the inflows and then

769
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,440
the outflows.

770
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,190
So the definition that we
mainly use in North America

771
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,880
is where the inflows into
a component are horizontal.

772
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,860
So the controller sends
information to the valve.

773
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,980
This is that blue
square right there.

774
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,100
And you can see that's shown
here on the block diagram.

775
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,530
But the valve also
sends information back

776
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,906
to the controller.

777
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:47,530
And that information
would probably be,

778
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,410
valve should open or close.

779
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,400
And when the valve
is actually opened,

780
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,920
it would confirm that
back to the controller

781
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,910
that the status of the
valve is open or closed.

782
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,150
And then we have
the energy flows.

783
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,839
The numbers that
are shown here, I

784
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,380
don't want to get
too much into this,

785
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,870
but there's a really
cool binary scheme

786
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,390
for putting a number
that you can then

787
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,220
have one number in that cell.

788
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,090
And based on that, you can,
through the binary code,

789
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,670
reverse engineer what
kind of interface is it.

790
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,720
Is it just physical?

791
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,230
Is it just binary?

792
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,810
It's a kind of trick for
replacing these colors

793
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,580
and cells with
just a number that

794
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,550
allows you to then reverse
engineer what kind of interface

795
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,290
is it.

796
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,680
So if it's empty, it means
there's no direct connection.

797
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,050
And then you have mechanical,
mass flows, information,

798
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,320
and energy flows.

799
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:47,390
So let me show you this on
a real example in a minute.

800
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,870
So this method, design
structure matrix method,

801
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,240
there's some synonyms for it--

802
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,270
design dependency
matrix, n-squared matrix,

803
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,460
n-squared diagram.

804
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,600
In matrix or graph theory, it's
called an adjacency matrix.

805
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,950
Don't be fooled;
it's the same thing.

806
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,770
It's just a square
matrix that shows

807
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,540
you what connects to what.

808
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,220
And then the simplest one is
just a binary, 0's and 1's.

809
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,640
But the richer DSMs, they
contain more information

810
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,040
about the type of interface.

811
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,720
So a lot of work
was done originally

812
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,460
by Don Steward on this.

813
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,920
This is an original
reference from '81.

814
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,310
And then at MIT, Professor Steve
Eppinger at the Sloan School

815
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,980
has done a lot of work on DSMs.

816
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,160
So fundamentally, it's
a matrix representation

817
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,320
of your product architecture.

818
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,270
Most of the literature
you find just

819
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,100
uses the simplest,
this binary DSM.

820
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,880
But I'm actually a fan
of adding information

821
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,190
into the DSM that tells
you about the physics

822
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,810
of the interface as well.

823
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,330
So let's look at
an example here.

824
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,420
Do you remember the
refrigerator case study

825
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,430
we did a few sessions ago?

826
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:00,650
So this is a liaison diagram,
level one decomposition.

827
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,390
So the refrigerator's been
decomposed into 10 components--

828
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,610
the door, the
condenser, power supply,

829
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,620
all the way to the compressor.

830
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,560
And all we're doing
here is saying

831
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,650
what is physically
connected to what.

832
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,380
And the reason it's
called a liaison diagram

833
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,200
is because it's going to help
you think about the assembly

834
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,670
sequence of how this
should be put together.

835
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,870
So another way to think about
this is like the skeleton.

836
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,590
This is the skeleton
of your system.

837
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,510
So if you do have a liaison
diagram, shown again--

838
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,180
this is the same one
on the left here--

839
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,330
you can just translate
that to a matrix.

840
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,150
The matrix, this DSM here,
I'm using X's instead of 1's.

841
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,630
But these two contain
exactly the same information.

842
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,860
One is a graph view, and
the other is a matrix view,

843
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,330
but they're identical--

844
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,220
the same thing, the
same information,

845
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,740
just presented in
a different way.

846
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,560
And of course, if you pay
close attention to the matrix,

847
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,450
you'll see it's
actually symmetric.

848
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,990
So then we can say, well,
what kinds of interfaces?

849
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,300
And here come the four
types that we just

850
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,480
discussed-- the physical
connection, energy flow,

851
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,950
mass flow, and information flow.

852
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,740
So if we apply that idea
to the refrigerator,

853
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,220
here's our 10 by 10
physical connections.

854
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,580
So we have a design
scripture matrix

855
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,080
with only the black marks.

856
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,640
So it's symmetric.

857
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,450
And this reflects
the liaison diagram.

858
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,900
And then we can add, on top
of that, the mass flows, which

859
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,010
are in red.

860
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,710
So the mass flows,
the way you read

861
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,040
this is we have a mass
flow from the compressor

862
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,110
to the condenser, and
then from the condenser

863
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,940
to the evaporator, and then
from the evaporator back

864
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,160
to the compressor.

865
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,550
Do you see that?

866
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,060
And we could rearrange these
to be closer to each other.

867
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,290
We could regroup the DSM.

868
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:15,500
But essentially, these red marks
represent the refrigerant cycle

869
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,850
within the refrigerator,
within the machine.

870
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:23,990
And so you can check by tracing
these from row to column.

871
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,370
You can actually check whether
the loop is properly closed.

872
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:33,440
So then energy flows, since the
refrigerant loop that I just

873
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,250
talked to you
about is important,

874
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,370
you can see that
those connections

875
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,050
we just talked about always also
carry a energy flow with them.

876
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,740
And then finally, information
flow is very little.

877
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,140
So in this case, there's only
one that I've represented,

878
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,480
which is the flow from the
thermostat to the power supply.

879
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,540
The thermostat defines the
temperature at which you

880
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,340
want to hold the refrigerator.

881
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,580
And if temperature goes
up, the power supply

882
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,710
kicks in and drives
the compressor.

883
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,510
And as soon as the temperature
falls below some threshold,

884
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,230
then it reverses, and
the compressor turns off.

885
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,300
So when your
refrigerator kicks in,

886
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,820
that's an information
flow from the thermostat

887
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,960
to the compressor
to the power supply.

888
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,520
If you own one of those fancy,
new Samsung refrigerators where

889
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,460
the door has a flat screen TV
in it and you can push buttons,

890
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,830
there's a lot more blue here.

891
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,580
There would be a lot
more blue in a really

892
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,760
high-end refrigerator
these days.

893
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,363
OK, any-- yes, please.

894
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:51,454
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

895
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:53,120
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah,
so the question--

896
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,911
I'm just going to repeat
the question-- is,

897
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:57,140
can you also map the
external interfaces?

898
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,690
And the answer is, absolutely.

899
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,640
So what you have
to do, though, then

900
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,360
is to kind of draw a
bigger box around this

901
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,210
and add here the
external elements--

902
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:16,090
so the human user, the wall
outlet, the grocery store,

903
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,620
wherever you're including in
your external world that's

904
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,030
interfacing with it.

905
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,180
You would have to represent
at least those elements that

906
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,520
have a direct connection
with any of it

907
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,380
across the system boundary.

908
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,530
You would add them
here, and then show--

909
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,660
but you would have to then
put a big box around it

910
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,918
to make it clear what's inside
the system and what's outside.

911
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:45,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

912
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,815
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's correct.

913
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:47,440
That's correct.

914
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,460
And we can argue-- of
course for the refrigerator,

915
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,290
the main interface
that you typically

916
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,590
have-- well, there are two.

917
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,660
Let's say we go for
what you're saying.

918
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,620
We're going to add some
external interfaces.

919
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:08,610
For a refrigerator, what are
the two or three most important?

920
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,729
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

921
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:13,770
OLIVIER DE WECK: Correct.

922
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,570
So where would that enter here?

923
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:31,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

924
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,940
OLIVIER DE WECK: The
power supply, right?

925
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,030
So we would add,
like, wall AC power.

926
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,850
If we added that, then in this
cell corresponding to that,

927
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,620
you would have an
inflow of power.

928
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,120
And then--

929
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

930
00:45:50,597 --> 00:45:52,430
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
this is the power supply

931
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,760
inside of the refrigerator,
inside the system boundary.

932
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,807
But if you had the wall outlet,
then that would be an external.

933
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,640
And then you would have
an interface across,

934
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,280
but into the power supply.

935
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,060
So that's one.

936
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,410
What's the other one?

937
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,600
Do you remember we talked
about the Carnot cycle?

938
00:46:12,558 --> 00:46:15,346
Well, yes, what do you
have to do with the heat?

939
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:16,120
AUDIENCE: Burn?

940
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,620
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so the
heat has to be removed, right,

941
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,180
radiated out.

942
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,740
And where does that happen?

943
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:33,070
Which element here is where
the heat gets removed,

944
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,034
which one of these 10?

945
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:38,964
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

946
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,130
OLIVIER DE WECK: Not really.

947
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,940
The refrigerant does the
internal heat transfer,

948
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,810
but the heat transfer to
the outside, to the air.

949
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:50,200
Refrigerators don't work
well in vacuum chambers.

950
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,720
Remember that.

951
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,370
It would be the evaporator.

952
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,430
It's at the
evaporator that you're

953
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,470
radiating the heat
to the surrounding

954
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,490
air, the environment.

955
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,330
So you'd have the surrounding
air as an external system,

956
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,770
and then and energy
transfer from the evaporator

957
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,060
to the outside.

958
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,830
But it's a good question.

959
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,000
So you have to always
define your system boundary.

960
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,450
So the question then is, when
do you generate these DSMs?

961
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,900
And fundamentally, there's two
ways, top-down or bottom-up.

962
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,930
So top-down, you start with
a model of your system.

963
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,110
And we talked about those
system modeling languages,

964
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,190
like SysML, or in
this case, OPM.

965
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,600
And then you hide some things.

966
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,190
You hide attributes and states.

967
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,590
You collapse all
your processes into

968
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:44,030
these tagged structural links,
and then you generate your DSM.

969
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,000
And then the other way to do it
is bottom-up where you already

970
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,950
have a design or a system.

971
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,270
You decompose it.

972
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,610
For example, you do
a product dissection.

973
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,880
You do your bill of
materials or your parts list.

974
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,660
Then you do your
liaison diagram.

975
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,850
You show the
physical connections.

976
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,980
And then on top of those
physical connections,

977
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,190
you map your mass, energy
and information flows.

978
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,240
And once you have that, then you
can start manipulating the DSM.

979
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,040
You can group
components differently.

980
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,930
You can show modules
and so forth.

981
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,680
So I want to show you a real
world-- this is not just

982
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,860
sort of an academic example,
but this is a real-world example

983
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,590
of a DSM that we built for a
research project with Xerox.

984
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,440
The machine that's represented
here is in the upper right.

985
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,760
This is the iGen3
digital printing press.

986
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,890
And represented here is its
architecture, its interfaces,

987
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,890
as an 84 by 84 DSM.

988
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,310
So the machine has been
decomposed into 84, really,

989
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,910
subsystems, because you have
a lot more than 84 parts.

990
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,020
But at this level of
abstraction of 84 by 84,

991
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:04,470
we have a total of 572 physical
connections, 45 mass flows,

992
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:10,399
167 energy flows, and
165 information flows.

993
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,940
And there's a little
more detail here

994
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,670
in terms of the types of flows.

995
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,360
So in red, we have mass
flows-- paper, toner, air,

996
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,790
ozone and dirt, because you've
got to keep dirt out of the--

997
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,540
the printing engine is
shown here in the middle.

998
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,600
Let me just show this.

999
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,350
So you're probably
scratching your head now.

1000
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,320
Ozone, really?

1001
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,270
Ozone?

1002
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,140
Why do we keep track of ozone?

1003
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,270
What do you think?

1004
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,211
Why do we care about ozone?

1005
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:46,620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
at ground level.

1006
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,080
OLIVIER DE WECK: It's a
pollutant at ground level.

1007
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,430
And where does the
pollutant come from?

1008
00:49:54,136 --> 00:49:55,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1009
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,480
OLIVIER DE WECK: So it's
generated inside the machine.

1010
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,545
The reason is these machines
use very high voltages.

1011
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:06,130
Xerographic processes
use pretty high voltages.

1012
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,280
So if you apply a
very high voltage,

1013
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,350
you actually generate
ozone through a--

1014
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,200
it's an electrochemical
reaction that

1015
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,670
happens inside the machine.

1016
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,590
Nobody used to care about
this until people working

1017
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,010
in these print shops
started to feel symptoms

1018
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,940
and started to complain.

1019
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,660
So in the US, it's called OSHA.

1020
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,414
That's the Occupation Safety
and Health Administration.

1021
00:50:31,414 --> 00:50:33,330
They came in, and they
took some measurements.

1022
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,420
And wow, the ozone level
is through the roof.

1023
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,870
It's multiple times above
the allowable maximum limit.

1024
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,760
And the reason is
because of this kind

1025
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,080
of xerographic process.

1026
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,800
So now, these machines
have to control the ozone.

1027
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,100
And essentially, this box here,
the printing engine, is sealed.

1028
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,050
It has its own air
conditioning system

1029
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,480
to prevent the ozone
from leaking out.

1030
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,960
It's a great example of how
occupational safety drove

1031
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,090
new requirements
which then increased

1032
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,690
the complexity of the machine.

1033
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,140
So we keep track
of the ozone flows.

1034
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,110
And then in green, we
have the usual suspects--

1035
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,890
high voltage, low voltage, DC,
mechanical energy, and then

1036
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:20,710
heat energy.

1037
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,700
So there's some coding
that goes on here.

1038
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:31,510
So in total, we have 1,033
non-empty cells here,

1039
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,280
which is about
3.7%, so about 4%.

1040
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,310
This DSM has a
density of about 4%.

1041
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,210
And that doesn't
sound very high.

1042
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:46,360
But believe me, this is
a very complex machine.

1043
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,030
This DSM that you see
here is version 31.

1044
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:55,400
So it took 31 versions
to create this DSM.

1045
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,230
And so why did it
take that long?

1046
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:03,390
Because this was published
as an official document

1047
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,820
capturing the architecture
of this machine.

1048
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,140
So what that means in practice
is of these 84 components

1049
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,980
or subsystems, every one of
those components or subsystems

1050
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,670
is owned by a different
person or a different team.

1051
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:25,100
And we went through a process
where all of these 84 teams,

1052
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,780
for their component, had
to sign off and say, yep,

1053
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,270
you've accurately
captured my interfaces.

1054
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,630
My physical, mass, information
and energy interfaces

1055
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,170
have been correctly
captured in this matrix.

1056
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,930
And oh, by the way, the empty
cells have also been certified.

1057
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,940
So if there's an
empty cell here,

1058
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,035
there's no question
whether, well, maybe it's

1059
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,560
just somebody forgot to
put the interface there.

1060
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,760
No.

1061
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,750
The owner of that row
and column certified

1062
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,240
that there is no
direct interface

1063
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,430
between this component
and the other component.

1064
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,640
That's why it took 31 versions.

1065
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,670
But now that you have this
map, you can do a lot of things

1066
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,220
with it.

1067
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,090
You can do
architectural analysis.

1068
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,640
You can benchmark
against other products.

1069
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,160
You can do what we call
technology infusion

1070
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,780
analysis, which was done.

1071
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,370
You can say, well,
what if we add

1072
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,780
this feature in the machine?

1073
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,060
OK, well, where is that
feature going to go?

1074
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,310
What are the interfaces
of that new feature?

1075
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,930
Do we have to
change the software?

1076
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,530
Do we have to
physically integrate it?

1077
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,980
This is a fantastic,
very powerful tool

1078
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,700
for showing the interfaces
and managing them.

1079
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,460
Any questions about
this DSM approach?

1080
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,360
The real way to do this is to
actually build one yourself.

1081
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,600
And you can see it's a lot of
work, but once you have it,

1082
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,835
it's very powerful.

1083
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:56,543
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

1084
00:53:56,543 --> 00:54:04,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1085
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,930
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
there's templates,

1086
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,430
like Excel templates.

1087
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,080
But there's also software.

1088
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,120
There's a website
called DSMweb.org.

1089
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,570
And I'm happy to send that
out for you as a resource.

1090
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,360
There's even yearly conferences.

1091
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,250
There are DSM conferences
where people get together

1092
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,930
from academia, from
different companies--

1093
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,830
like BMW, for example.

1094
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,320
I'm a big fan of BMW.

1095
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,920
I think they do a great job.

1096
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,680
Their system engineering
is very, very strong.

1097
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,550
They use this on
all their vehicles,

1098
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,490
on all their subsystems.

1099
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,190
And so this
DSMweb.org, you'll see

1100
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:48,360
sort of the software that's
available and so forth.

1101
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,130
There's also some commercial
software available.

1102
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,470
So yeah, please, go ahead.

1103
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1104
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:58,440
OLIVIER DE WECK: Ah.

1105
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,540
So let's think about this.

1106
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,430
The 7 plus or minus 2, how
does the 7 plus or minus

1107
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,650
2 relate to the 84?

1108
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,290
This is an 84 by 84 DSM.

1109
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,848
So how do the two
relate to each other?

1110
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:15,032
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1111
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:15,990
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

1112
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:21,406
But what's the relationship of
that rule with the 84 by 84?

1113
00:55:21,406 --> 00:55:25,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1114
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:27,630
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so
this machine might have--

1115
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,310
if you really want
every little detail,

1116
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,500
this is probably a
level 4, level 5, right?

1117
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,310
But what's shown here, this
is essentially the equivalent

1118
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,250
of a level two representation.

1119
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,140
So do you remember
7 plus or minus

1120
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:49,600
2 squared is somewhere between
25 at the low end and 81.

1121
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,200
So we're just
slightly above this.

1122
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,800
So my argument here is this
is essentially a level two

1123
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,860
DSM where you decompose
the system down two levels,

1124
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,530
and then you show the
DSM the interfaces

1125
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,360
at this level of abstraction.

1126
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,170
You could go level
three, but now you're

1127
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,030
going to have a 500
by 500 DSM, which

1128
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:15,560
is almost impossible for a human
to really understand and get

1129
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,370
any use out of it.

1130
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,480
There's also been some
work in hierarchical DSMs.

1131
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,000
So for example, if you
look at the feeder system--

1132
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,586
you see in the upper left
here that says "feeder"?

1133
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:30,020
Well, what is the feeder?

1134
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,070
It's all this upfront stuff that
feeds your paper and your media

1135
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:35,630
into the print engine.

1136
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,830
So you could take--

1137
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,660
this is just two rows here.

1138
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,060
You could take those and break
those into much greater detail.

1139
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,380
So you'd have-- kind of like you
guys did the requirements tree,

1140
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,910
the requirements hierarchy.

1141
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,180
You can have a
hierarchy of DSMs.

1142
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,650
I'm not showing that here,
but that's the relationship.

1143
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,490
This is essentially a level
two decomposition DSM.

1144
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,650
Good question.

1145
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,000
MIT, any questions?

1146
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:06,820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just have
one question about the liaison

1147
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,440
diagram.

1148
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,400
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah?

1149
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,070
AUDIENCE: Is there, I guess,
any meaning or information

1150
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:15,970
that comes from the distances
between-- like when you draw

1151
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,330
it, the way that you draw it?

1152
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,830
OLIVIER DE WECK: No,
there really isn't.

1153
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,900
So the tricky thing is if
it's a very complex system,

1154
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,390
like if we did the liaison
diagram for the 84 by 84--

1155
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,760
let me just go back here--

1156
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,770
it would be pretty messy.

1157
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:38,160
And so you want to sort of
do the layout of the liaison

1158
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,080
diagram so you minimize the
number of crossing lines,

1159
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,520
for example.

1160
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,470
There's actually some graph
visualization algorithms

1161
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:52,960
that try to create as clean
as possible of a graph.

1162
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,920
One of those is--

1163
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,920
it's called a spring
energy algorithm.

1164
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,100
It basically treats these links
as though they were springs.

1165
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,400
And then depending on
how far things are,

1166
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,360
there's spring energy.

1167
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,160
And you want to minimize the
total energy of the system.

1168
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,250
And by doing that, usually,
the graph looks pretty clean.

1169
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,240
But there's no inherent
meaning in how you lay it out.

1170
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,620
Does that makes sense, Sam?

1171
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

1172
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,296
AUDIENCE: I have
a question too--

1173
00:58:22,296 --> 00:58:23,520
OLIVIER DE WECK: Go ahead.

1174
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,070
AUDIENCE: --about
the liaison diagrams.

1175
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,170
I was doing something
similar, at least where

1176
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,560
I had each block as a
functional aspect of the system.

1177
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,780
It was for an avionics system.

1178
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,390
And I found that I needed
to, like, make power

1179
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,900
a separate thing because
it was more of like a tree.

1180
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,980
We had one power
distribution system.

1181
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,970
But the thing I wanted to bring
up was the information flow.

1182
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,190
Originally I just had
one color for that,

1183
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,250
but I didn't find
that too useful.

1184
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,930
What I plan on doing
is splitting it

1185
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,400
up into command and telemetry.

1186
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,990
So is drawing information just
as one entity typically done?

1187
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,320
Because I think it's more useful
to have command and telemetry,

1188
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,210
or like data and commands.

1189
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,430
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
you know, that's fine.

1190
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,680
And depending on what
you're going to use it for,

1191
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,770
you can redefine the colors.

1192
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:20,220
There's no global standard
for how to properly do a DSM.

1193
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,020
That's still kind of evolving.

1194
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,080
So if you have different types--

1195
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,420
and you saw in
the Xerox example,

1196
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,750
we used letters as well for the
different types of mass flows--

1197
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,170
P for paper, T for toner.

1198
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,140
So the way you're going to
code it is really up to you.

1199
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,640
There's no global, right
one way to do it yet.

1200
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,730
So that sounds good.

1201
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,852
Actually, you did the
right thing there.

1202
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:46,810
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

1203
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,478
OLIVIER DE WECK: How
are we doing time-wise?

1204
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:50,450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1205
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,670
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

1206
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,210
Any other questions?

1207
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,126
Yes?

1208
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:58,271
AUDIENCE: What kind
of [INAUDIBLE]??

1209
00:59:58,271 --> 01:00:00,020
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
why are we doing this?

1210
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,796
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

1211
01:00:01,796 --> 01:00:03,420
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Well, pretty pictures.

1212
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,890
No, I'm sort of half-joking.

1213
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:12,110
Part of it is definitely a
graphical, visual, powerful way

1214
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,080
to convey the whole
system architecture.

1215
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,180
If you think about it,
there aren't too many ways

1216
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,390
of actually visualizing
the whole system.

1217
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,220
This is a very abstract view.

1218
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,200
But there's a-- and then
this DSM here at Xerox,

1219
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,856
it printed out as a
huge, wall-sized poster.

1220
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:30,980
And you put it on the wall.

1221
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,380
And people actually go
up there and say, ah,

1222
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,580
that's my subsystem.

1223
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,660
And then they
argue and so forth.

1224
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,255
So part of it is
definitely a visualization.

1225
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:40,880
But the other thing
you can do with it,

1226
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,400
particularly if you start
putting the numbers in,

1227
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,280
you can use this for
complexity quantification.

1228
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,420
So you can quantify the
complexity of your system

1229
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,960
and then compare it
against a competing system

1230
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,790
or a prior generation system.

1231
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,339
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1232
01:00:58,339 --> 01:00:59,380
OLIVIER DE WECK: Correct.

1233
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,972
AUDIENCE: You could not
have a macro view on it.

1234
01:01:01,972 --> 01:01:02,930
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

1235
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,570
So this is a macro view,
but if you really-- then you

1236
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,300
need to put numbers
for the component

1237
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,580
complexities, the interface
complexities and so forth.

1238
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,030
And there's quite a bit
of research in this.

1239
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,000
So you can then move this
from a purely visual tool

1240
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,160
to becoming an analytic tool.

1241
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:19,887
Yes?

1242
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:33,304
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1243
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:34,220
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

1244
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,020
And one thing we'll
talk about next

1245
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:41,360
is interface control documents
as an important-- so in theory,

1246
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,820
in theory, every one
of these interfaces,

1247
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:48,400
you can have a document
or a digital file

1248
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,450
if you click on this.

1249
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,330
And this is where the tools
are not fully mature yet.

1250
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,670
But you'd like to be
able to click on this,

1251
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,980
and then it links you
to another document.

1252
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,750
And what is that other document?

1253
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,300
It's the ICD, the
Interface Control Document

1254
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,992
that defines that interface.

1255
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:05,450
And then you have
a lot of details.

1256
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:09,290
Like if it's an electrical
connector, how many pins,

1257
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,930
what's the function of each pin?

1258
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:16,220
And that's really where
things become useful, OK?

1259
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,160
All right, let me move on.

1260
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,920
But I did upload for you guys.

1261
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,780
So it's really up to you if you
want to do a DSM at your PDR.

1262
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,480
It would be nice, but
I don't absolutely--

1263
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,900
if you like this, if
you think it's useful,

1264
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,400
try it out for the PDR.

1265
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,950
But it's not a
must-have requirement.

1266
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:42,200
But in the full-year
SDM class that we teach,

1267
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,010
we're just doing that right now.

1268
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,670
And so you can
use it for reverse

1269
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,260
engineering the architecture
of a software package.

1270
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,290
You like open source software.

1271
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,000
You just download it.

1272
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,310
You generate a DSM,
and you can start

1273
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:58,130
seeing what are the different
modules in the code, what

1274
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,320
do they do, how do they
talk to each other.

1275
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,825
It's incredibly powerful.

1276
01:03:01,825 --> 01:03:06,740
But what I did do is I
uploaded for you guys--

1277
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,870
I said there's a
top-down, and then there's

1278
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,930
a reverse engineering or
bottom-up way of doing it.

1279
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:16,000
This is a 17-step
procedure, pretty detailed,

1280
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,120
a document that I uploaded
under the reading section.

1281
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,410
So if you go on the website,
under the reading section,

1282
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,320
you will find--

1283
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,440
this is like a four or five-page
document that says step

1284
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,110
by step how do you do a DSM.

1285
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,000
And again, so at a high level,
then, what you get out of it

1286
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,350
is--

1287
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,300
here, I've sort of
hidden the details

1288
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,530
from what you saw before--

1289
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:42,320
is the high-level
architecture you can see.

1290
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,540
So in the case of
the Xerox example,

1291
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,480
we have our frontend
system, the feeder system,

1292
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,770
the main marking engine.

1293
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,020
You can see the modules.

1294
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,680
And then you have the
finishing system down here.

1295
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,610
And so many systems and products
have similar architectures.

1296
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,690
OK, any questions
before I move on.

1297
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:08,950
Let's talk about ICDs,
Interface Control Documents.

1298
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,820
And in the system engineering
engine from the handbook,

1299
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,560
this is right here
in the middle.

1300
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,140
This is the technical
management processes.

1301
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,020
Number 12, interface management.

1302
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,610
It's a huge deal.

1303
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:24,550
If you don't do it
well, if you don't

1304
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,170
do interface management well--

1305
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,480
and we heard some examples--

1306
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,870
it's really trouble.

1307
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,510
So the purpose is for
controlling your development

1308
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,280
effort.

1309
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,900
It's really important-- I just
highlighted a few words here--

1310
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,050
if you have geographically
diverse technical teams.

1311
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:44,230
And maintaining
interface definition,

1312
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:49,430
once you've decomposed your
system, is absolutely critical.

1313
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,820
So let me talk briefly
about the different--

1314
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,400
so this is a little bit
more like traditional system

1315
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,910
engineering where you define
the interface with a document.

1316
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,430
We've said that system
engineering is moving

1317
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,050
to become more model-based.

1318
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:05,230
We don't want big
piles of paper anymore.

1319
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:08,860
But the reality is that many
projects and programs still

1320
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,900
have a lot of these documents.

1321
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,150
Ideally, you'd just have
a model, a digital model

1322
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,020
of the interface.

1323
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,170
Then you don't need
a separate document.

1324
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:20,830
But if you are working with
suppliers or contractors that

1325
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,010
don't have the same modeling
capability as you have,

1326
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,660
these documents are critical.

1327
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,290
So the first one, it's called
IRD, Interface Requirements

1328
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,370
Document.

1329
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,300
And this is-- do you remember
when you did the requirements

1330
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,670
analysis in assignment two?

1331
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,710
This is one of the six
classes of requirements

1332
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:41,030
is interface requirements.

1333
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,570
So that's the idea, is all
the interface requirements

1334
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,220
are pulled together into an IRD.

1335
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,070
It defines the
functional, performance,

1336
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:51,820
electrical, environmental,
human, physical requirements

1337
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:55,480
and constraints that exist at
the common boundary between two

1338
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,060
or more functions
or system elements.

1339
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,350
So you haven't designed the
interface yet, physically,

1340
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:05,090
but you've defined what the
interface should be able to do,

1341
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,140
its functionality.

1342
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,570
Then we have-- this
is the most common.

1343
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,720
You've probably heard
this acronym before--

1344
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,790
is ICDs, Interface Control
Document or Interface Control

1345
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:17,890
Drawing.

1346
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,280
And so that is essentially the
specification of the interface.

1347
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,360
What does the
interface look like?

1348
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,740
So if you look at a ICD of
an electrical connector,

1349
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,190
you'll see the pin-out,
you see the voltage levels,

1350
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:33,640
you'll see the purpose of
each signal for each pin.

1351
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,630
Maybe there's some pins
that are unused that

1352
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,600
are reserved for future use.

1353
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,940
That's also very
clearly defined.

1354
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:45,160
And the key about the ICD is
it's a two-sided document.

1355
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,010
So there's a subsystem
A and a subsystem B,

1356
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,990
and they share a
common interface.

1357
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,390
And the ICD, the Interface
Control Document,

1358
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,990
will define both sides of
the interface as opposed

1359
01:06:55,990 --> 01:07:01,390
to IDD, Interface
Definition Document,

1360
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:05,240
which is only a one-sided
or unilateral document.

1361
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,290
So for example, let's
say your company makes

1362
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:13,920
a very fancy camera or sensor
to be used on a spacecraft,

1363
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,020
but you don't know who is
going to use that camera,

1364
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,370
how are they going to use it.

1365
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,490
So what you're
defining is essentially

1366
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,320
your side of the interface--

1367
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,630
physical, functional.

1368
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:31,480
And then it's up to whoever
your customer is to take the IDD

1369
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,730
and turn it into an ICD.

1370
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,300
But the IDD is only
one-sided, unilateral.

1371
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,570
And the ICD is bilateral,
interface definition.

1372
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,370
Does that make sense?

1373
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,780
OK.

1374
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,080
So here's-- again, this
is from the handbook,

1375
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,690
the system
engineering handbook--

1376
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,980
interface management.

1377
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,570
On the input side,
you start with

1378
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,150
your interface
requirements, any changes

1379
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,790
to the interface that come
up during the lifecycle

1380
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,050
of the project.

1381
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,080
You go through the steps and
out come your interface control

1382
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,370
documents, any requirements
changes, and then interface

1383
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,080
management work
products, which might

1384
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,310
be other supporting documents.

1385
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:14,020
For example, a user manual
or an operator manual

1386
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:17,979
that will actually tell you how
to properly use the interface

1387
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:22,149
would be an example of
a supporting document.

1388
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:25,470
OK, any questions
about that before we

1389
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,800
get to system integration?

1390
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,399
So who's actually
read an ICD or had

1391
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,680
an actual ICD in their hands?

1392
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,440
You have, yeah?

1393
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,000
[INAUDIBLE],, I'm sure
you've had that many times.

1394
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,316
Can you tell us what it was?

1395
01:08:41,316 --> 01:08:43,361
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1396
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:45,069
OLIVIER DE WECK: Let
me give you the mic.

1397
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:49,560
So-- [INAUDIBLE]

1398
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,460
AUDIENCE: So we were
working on a project

1399
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,770
where a Chinese asked us to
contribute a camera payload

1400
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,689
for their satellites.

1401
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:08,760
And so we had to define all the
electrical and data interfaces.

1402
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,279
I was in charge of
the data interfaces.

1403
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:18,120
And there were design documents
saying how will the interaction

1404
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,380
work between the two systems.

1405
01:09:23,051 --> 01:09:23,550
Let's see.

1406
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,069
Because [INAUDIBLE]
protocol, I had

1407
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:32,460
to tell the satellites what to
do if the camera fails and how

1408
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,010
should the camera
fail if there is

1409
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:39,702
a problem on the computer,
so all the failure cases

1410
01:09:39,702 --> 01:09:40,660
and this kind of thing.

1411
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:44,380
OLIVIER DE WECK: So it
sounds like [INAUDIBLE]..

1412
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's an ICD.

1413
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,210
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good.

1414
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,853
And was it used then, or--

1415
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1416
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,500
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Great, excellent.

1417
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:02,320
Any examples of an ICD or
IDD or IRD on the MIT side?

1418
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,051
Anybody have
experience with this?

1419
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:11,590
AUDIENCE: No.

1420
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,610
OLIVIER DE WECK: Was
that you, your honor?

1421
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,850
AUDIENCE: Yes, I personally
have experience with ICDs,

1422
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,839
but no one in the room does.

1423
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:24,380
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, well, why
don't you tell us about yours?

1424
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,482
Because I know you worked on
this gravity gradient sensor.

1425
01:10:27,482 --> 01:10:28,440
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

1426
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,065
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
maybe that example.

1427
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:31,800
Yeah, why don't you
tell us about that?

1428
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,850
AUDIENCE: So each
system had its own ICD.

1429
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,340
And that was primarily
because the rest of the team

1430
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,410
needed to understand
the inputs and outputs

1431
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,837
and how the specific
system works.

1432
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,670
So it not only works
for system integration.

1433
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,190
It just works for
the team as a whole

1434
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,750
in its understanding
of the project

1435
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,095
and the particular systems.

1436
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,410
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

1437
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:57,820
All right, so this is a really,
really big deal in practice.

1438
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,350
If you do something that's--

1439
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,790
so for example, if
you make a design,

1440
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,085
you modify the interface
because you think, ah,

1441
01:11:06,085 --> 01:11:06,910
it's better for me.

1442
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,710
I'm going to change this.

1443
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,830
And it's different from the ICD.

1444
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:14,410
And then there's a
failure in your system.

1445
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:17,110
And then you say you're going
to blame the supplier and say,

1446
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,760
your box failed.

1447
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,730
My mission got screwed
up because of your box.

1448
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,640
And then it turns
out, ah, you actually

1449
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:30,430
implemented an interface that's
in conflict with the ICD.

1450
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:35,410
The supplier will step back
and say, that's not my problem.

1451
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,780
You didn't follow the
interface definition,

1452
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:40,810
and just changing one
pin or one polarity

1453
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,330
can lead to a system failure.

1454
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:46,120
So really, you have to
pay a lot of attention

1455
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,170
to the details here.

1456
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,780
OK, let's talk about
system integration.

1457
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,950
So what is it?

1458
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,850
It's essentially the
process of deliberately--

1459
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,920
so let's say you've
designed your system.

1460
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,430
The interfaces are clear.

1461
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,860
When you physically put
together your system,

1462
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,979
you have to
integrate the system.

1463
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:06,270
So that means different things.

1464
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,730
Physical assembly
of the parts, that's

1465
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,790
the liaison diagram,
what fits into what.

1466
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,310
And we'll talk about
sequencing in a minute.

1467
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:18,510
You need to connect your
different conduits and hoses.

1468
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,180
You need to fill in
various consumables--

1469
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,900
fuel, lubricants.

1470
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,870
An example in space
flight would be

1471
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,140
if you're going to
use a cryocooler,

1472
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,540
you might have to use
some gases or liquids

1473
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,570
for the cyrocooler
that are consumables,

1474
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,100
finite consumables.

1475
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,100
Connecting all your electronics
to the power sources,

1476
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,480
the avionics.

1477
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,060
Wire harnesses are
still used a lot.

1478
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,430
We would love to get rid
of wire harnesses, right?

1479
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,040
They're heavy.

1480
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:48,831
They're cumbersome.

1481
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,570
They're expensive.

1482
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:54,900
And we've been trying to replace
wire harnesses with wireless,

1483
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,630
but it's really hard to
make it work reliably.

1484
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:01,000
So we still use wire
harnesses quite a bit.

1485
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,730
And then you need
to upload and test

1486
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:07,690
your operational software
that sits inside your system.

1487
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,950
So that's a lot of work, and it
has to be done very carefully.

1488
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,590
A lot of this is
done in facilities

1489
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:16,140
that are very
clean, clean rooms,

1490
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,000
because you really need
to do every step properly.

1491
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,650
You need to document every step.

1492
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:21,735
There's quality control.

1493
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:28,080
And that's why it's
expensive and slow.

1494
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,240
So the next point
here is the sequence

1495
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,910
in which the integration
occurs may be important.

1496
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,470
And I want to--

1497
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,410
so the reading, the post-reading
associated with this lecture,

1498
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:43,440
is a paper by Ben-Asher, who's a
professor at Technion in Israel

1499
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,380
who I think has done some of
the best work, theoretical work,

1500
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,270
on system integration.

1501
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:52,080
And unfortunately, in complex
systems, a lot of problems

1502
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,220
are errors.

1503
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,220
We often discover them during
system integration and testing.

1504
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,180
So that's also a key point here.

1505
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,320
OK, so let me--

1506
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,387
I hope you have a chance to
read this Ben-Asher paper,

1507
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:06,720
because it's pretty interesting.

1508
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,780
But I'll give you sort of the
summary here on one slide.

1509
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,800
So what they looked
at was, does it

1510
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,610
matter whether you do a
single-stage integration,

1511
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,620
everything at once,
or you do what's

1512
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,930
called incremental integration?

1513
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,820
So the idea of
incremental integration

1514
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:27,630
is you just integrate two
components or subsystems

1515
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,550
in isolation at a time.

1516
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,840
You check them, and then you
gradually integrate as opposed

1517
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,640
to doing it all at once.

1518
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:40,830
And the example in the paper is
UAV, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

1519
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:44,130
And there's not a lot
of detail, but there's

1520
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:46,650
four major subsystems--
the engine,

1521
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:50,430
the flight control system,
the optronic payload,

1522
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,010
and then the payload
control system.

1523
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:58,250
And so in one case, you would
do a single-stage integration.

1524
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,930
So here's your four
subsystems, and you just

1525
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,871
integrate them all at once.

1526
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:04,620
And that's shown here
in this upper graph.

1527
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,920
So this is not the
graph of components.

1528
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,820
This is the graph of
integration steps.

1529
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,770
And then you have
to put the system,

1530
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,770
once it's integrated, these
step seven, eight, nine,

1531
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,420
through different tests.

1532
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,910
And then the idea
is that the amount

1533
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:24,450
of time that it takes to do
each of these integration steps

1534
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,190
is somewhat stochastic.

1535
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,890
It's not a deterministic number.

1536
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,140
And so this upper
graph here that

1537
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:37,410
looks kind of like a ski jump,
this is time, number of days,

1538
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:40,320
versus the probability.

1539
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,310
So what you see here is
that it's right-skewed--

1540
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,190
or left-skewed, depending
on how you define it.

1541
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:50,280
But the peak here
is to the right.

1542
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,410
And so the idea is that if
everything goes super smoothly,

1543
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,720
actually, single-stage
integration

1544
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,430
could work very well.

1545
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,760
But the likelihood of that
happening is not high.

1546
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,950
And if you think about
it, if you do all at once,

1547
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,290
single-stage integration,
troubleshooting

1548
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,760
becomes more complex as well.

1549
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,700
And so that's why this curve is
actually shifted to the right.

1550
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,290
Incremental integration,
in this case,

1551
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:21,540
you're just integrating two
and two, two and two, and then

1552
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,461
you integrate your
pre-integrated subsystems

1553
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:24,960
together.

1554
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,170
So it looks more gradual.

1555
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,610
And then here is--

1556
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:31,890
again, using their model.

1557
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,680
They have made certain
assumptions about this--

1558
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,310
you get a somewhat broader
distribution of outcomes.

1559
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:42,930
But the mean, the expected
amount of time for integration,

1560
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,570
is actually less.

1561
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:48,540
So you have a faster
integration time

1562
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:52,090
on average with
incremental approach.

1563
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:57,540
But in the worst case, you
may be a little bit longer

1564
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,970
than the single-stage
integration.

1565
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:02,460
But what really matters
is, what's the average?

1566
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,690
So the conclusion in the
paper is that the integration

1567
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:09,230
sequence is important, that
the integration sequence can

1568
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:12,140
be optimized, that
there's advantages

1569
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,940
of doing incremental
integration,

1570
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,850
primarily from a
risk perspective.

1571
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:23,900
So again, Octanus 1
project, maybe you guys

1572
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,580
haven't thought about
this too much yet.

1573
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,390
Maybe you have.

1574
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:31,130
But when you do
your final vehicle,

1575
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,250
the sequence in which everything
gets integrated and tested

1576
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,970
is important.

1577
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,550
That's really what this says.

1578
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:43,690
And an incremental approach
can be very helpful.

1579
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,530
The more components
you have, the more

1580
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,790
the combinatorial
space of integration

1581
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,720
sequences gets
bigger and bigger.

1582
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,730
So you have to do this at
some level of abstraction.

1583
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,860
Is that clear?

1584
01:17:54,860 --> 01:18:03,434
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1585
01:18:03,434 --> 01:18:04,350
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

1586
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,766
And so the way you
describe-- this

1587
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:07,290
is driven by your supply chain.

1588
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:09,000
When are things
becoming available?

1589
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,110
But you have to be
careful because it could

1590
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:15,460
be sort of risk-driven as well.

1591
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:18,540
So OK, good.

1592
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,520
Any questions at MIT?

1593
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,770
Any comments about this?

1594
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,675
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

1595
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:29,550
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yup.

1596
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:30,925
AUDIENCE: So I
guess the takeaway

1597
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:34,740
is that incremental integration
is usually preferred

1598
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:39,150
for most things, on average?

1599
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,650
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1600
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:43,140
Read the paper.

1601
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:46,950
I think the conclusion
is that for new systems

1602
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,100
that you've never
integrated before,

1603
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:55,050
where your level of knowledge
and the TRL levels-- or you've

1604
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:58,380
never done this before, first
of a kind of integration,

1605
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,530
that incremental is better
because if there's a problem,

1606
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:04,230
then troubleshooting is easier.

1607
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:07,540
Now, if you're integrating
a very well known system--

1608
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:12,510
so it's sort of the 10th system,
but you've sort of figured out

1609
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,700
where the bugs are--

1610
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:18,410
so the risk level, the
uncertainty is low.

1611
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:21,030
Maybe then, single-stage
integration is OK.

1612
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:25,000
So it really depends on
the novelty and risk.

1613
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,250
So I don't think the
conclusion of the paper

1614
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:31,960
is single-stage
integration is bad, always.

1615
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,550
I think it's that you
should think carefully

1616
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:39,510
about the sequencing, and it's
driven by the amount of risk.

1617
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,480
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

1618
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,040
OLIVIER DE WECK:
All right, good.

1619
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,090
So we're almost at the end here.

1620
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,580
I want to ask you
a quick question.

1621
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,340
This is our concept
question for today.

1622
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,850
And this is about
interface standards.

1623
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:04,170
So over time in
different industries,

1624
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,350
rather than
reinventing the wheel

1625
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:09,350
and coming up with custom
interfaces for every project

1626
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,930
you do, you say,
do the interface

1627
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,090
according to this
standard or that standard.

1628
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,720
So I'm just curious to
know from you guys--

1629
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,380
and I asked this question
last week from another class

1630
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,460
I teach at MIT.

1631
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:26,810
So please answer this, and then
I'm going to show your answers

1632
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,900
and the answers of the
other class combined.

1633
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,270
So the interface
definitions here are 802.11,

1634
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:42,230
[? MIL-STD-1553, ?]
RS-232, BB_aJ23100.

1635
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:45,290
And then if you know of any
other interface standards

1636
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,690
that you think are
important, just click Other.

1637
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:49,100
This is a multi--

1638
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,440
there's not just one
right answer here.

1639
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,510
This is a
multi-checkbox question.

1640
01:20:55,510 --> 01:21:00,890
All right, so here's
the responses.

1641
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:04,250
So 56%-- so this
is your results,

1642
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:08,420
and then my class from last
week, kind of mixed together.

1643
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:11,750
So 56% know the 802.11.

1644
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:12,770
So what is--

1645
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:17,510
I thought it might be more
than 56%, but what is 802.11?

1646
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,390
AUDIENCE: Wi-Fi.

1647
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,389
OLIVIER DE WECK: It's the
Wi-Fi standard, right?

1648
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:23,630
And now, G I think is
the latest, I think.

1649
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:26,830
It's sort of ABC, 802.11 ABC.

1650
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:30,850
So it's kind of
evolving standard--

1651
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,030
very important, obviously.

1652
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:39,940
[? MIL-STD-1553, ?] 24%
know about that one.

1653
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,770
Anybody here, any [INAUDIBLE],,
[? MIL-STD-1553? ?] So

1654
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,270
you've done rural
engineering, I can tell.

1655
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,310
So what is the 1553?

1656
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,720
AUDIENCE: It's [INAUDIBLE].

1657
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:57,420
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yes, it's a DoD.

1658
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,700
So that's what's a
military standard.

1659
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,250
It's essentially a data bus.

1660
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:07,590
So for example, on military
planes, on many satellites,

1661
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,290
it's essentially the
architecture of the avionics.

1662
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,790
It's a bus architecture.

1663
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:15,990
So you typically have like
a mission computer that's

1664
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:19,335
the brain, and then it
directs how the messages

1665
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:21,660
are sent from the different--

1666
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:25,440
like the flight control
system or the payload.

1667
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,890
It's kind of an old standard,
but it's a very robust standard

1668
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,290
for avionics architectures.

1669
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,580
OK, at MIT, RS-232?

1670
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,110
This is also kind of
an older standard.

1671
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,460
Anybody chose that?

1672
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,910
AUDIENCE: It's a--

1673
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,360
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did anybody--

1674
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,200
go ahead.

1675
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,820
AUDIENCE: --communication
protocol for electronics.

1676
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,760
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right, but
it's a very specific one.

1677
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,950
There's a keyword
I'm looking for.

1678
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,519
AUDIENCE: Serial.

1679
01:22:59,519 --> 01:23:00,810
OLIVIER DE WECK: Serial, right.

1680
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,720
It's a serial
interface, as opposed

1681
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,340
to a parallel interface.

1682
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:08,030
So it's a serial interface.

1683
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,920
And still, it's kind
of old-fashioned,

1684
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,800
but it's still used.

1685
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:17,360
All right, now comes BB_aJ23100.

1686
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:22,940
And nobody, out of
119, knew what that is.

1687
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,730
So-- and this is kind
of a trick question--

1688
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:29,760
this is a BioBricks interface.

1689
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,870
So are you familiar
with synthetic biology?

1690
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:36,320
So synthetic biology,
the basic idea

1691
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:41,390
is that you can do what we do
here for biological systems.

1692
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:45,900
So there's libraries of
parts, standard library

1693
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:50,060
of biological parts,
like different proteins,

1694
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:53,580
that you can actually
assemble organisms.

1695
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,325
There's an annual competition.

1696
01:23:55,325 --> 01:23:57,800
It's been going on for
almost a decade now.

1697
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,210
It's kind of scary, actually.

1698
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:03,650
But so far, nothing really
bad has happened, I guess.

1699
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:08,930
But the idea is that in
biology, it's going this way.

1700
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:11,990
So you can look this up.

1701
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,930
You can google for this
particular reference,

1702
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:19,280
and it'll guide you to
essentially a protein

1703
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,060
interface.

1704
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,900
It's essentially a molecular,
biological interface.

1705
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:30,800
So the prediction here is that
10, 20, 30 years from now,

1706
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,240
people will know what this is.

1707
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,710
And there will be a very
internationally recognized set

1708
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:43,100
of biological interfaces that
people actually use and know.

1709
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,950
And then anybody
chose Other here?

1710
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:49,510
Anybody choose other?

1711
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,450
Yeah, you did?

1712
01:24:53,086 --> 01:24:56,690
AUDIENCE: Like
standard USB and HDMI?

1713
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,900
OLIVIER DE WECK: And USB
has evolved as well, right?

1714
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,480
We had USB 1.0,
and then USB 2.0.

1715
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,600
Isn't that the latest still?

1716
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,712
AUDIENCE: USB-C.

1717
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:05,670
OLIVIER DE WECK: C, OK.

1718
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,060
AUDIENCE: It's reversible.

1719
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,070
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, so standards

1720
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,917
evolve as well, right,
as the technology

1721
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,250
behind the standards-- you know.

1722
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,740
So this is a huge
deal in practice.

1723
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:20,768
Anybody at MIT chose
Other, other examples?

1724
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I chose Other.

1725
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:28,880
Things that come to mind
are like SPI and I2C,

1726
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,330
more like serial electronic
communication protocols

1727
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:35,580
that are useful for
talking to chips.

1728
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,660
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

1729
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,750
So those are sort of
inside the IC world, right?

1730
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:48,980
OK, excellent.

1731
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,400
So all right, well,
we are actually

1732
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,390
at the end of today's lecture.

1733
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,320
So I just want to
summarize the key points.

1734
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,880
Why is interface
management important?

1735
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,650
There are many reasons, but I
think the two top reasons are--

1736
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:07,320
think of interfaces as a
potential Achilles heel.

1737
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,490
They're potentially
seeds for failures.

1738
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:12,170
We saw bottlenecks.

1739
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,150
We saw structural failures.

1740
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:17,360
We saw the wrong
kind of information

1741
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,730
being passed through software.

1742
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,560
And so be careful.

1743
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,240
And if there's nobody in
charge in your project

1744
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,150
to really look after the
interfaces, that's a problem.

1745
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:34,890
So you want to really
think about this

1746
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:38,760
because almost any project
today, you're decomposing it,

1747
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,640
and you're not doing
everything in-house yourself.

1748
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,320
You're going to
deal with suppliers.

1749
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,210
You're going to
deal with partners.

1750
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:49,200
So of course you have an
organizational, contractual

1751
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,650
interface with them, but there's
a physical interface as well.

1752
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:55,530
The longer you wait to
define that interface

1753
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:59,190
with your partners and
suppliers, the fuzzier it is,

1754
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:01,350
the more problems you will have.

1755
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,800
So critical to really
define the interface,

1756
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,200
and then stick with the
interface very sharply.

1757
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,570
Interface management has
different aspects to it.

1758
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,510
So first of all,
types of interfaces,

1759
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:18,090
there are many, many
dozens or hundreds

1760
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:21,000
of types of interfaces, but
they can all be boiled down

1761
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,190
to the four canonical types--

1762
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:27,660
physical connection, mass,
energy, and information flows.

1763
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,500
I've introduced you to the DSM,
the Design Structure Matrix

1764
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,790
method.

1765
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:37,110
And that's where you basically
decompose your system,

1766
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,380
and you show it as
an n by n matrix.

1767
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,600
And then you put
all the interfaces

1768
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,690
into that matrix
that you know about,

1769
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:48,840
not just the interfaces
that you want to have,

1770
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,070
but the interfaces that
are actually there.

1771
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:56,580
So if there's noise,
or vibration, or EMI,

1772
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:00,660
Electromagnetic
Interference, or waste heat,

1773
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,760
those are also
important because you're

1774
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,720
going to have to deal
with them in some way.

1775
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,030
Finally, ICDs.

1776
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:12,480
So ICDS-- and we said there's
IRDs, Interface Requirements

1777
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,580
Documents, which are the
requirements for the interface;

1778
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,440
IDDs, one-sided; and then
ICDs are the most important.

1779
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,980
It's the two-sided
interface definition.

1780
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:27,570
That's the NASA approach,
but [? ISA ?] uses that.

1781
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:30,540
Many, many industries now
use these interface control

1782
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,890
documents.

1783
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,710
Ideally, in the long-term,
we want to get rid of them.

1784
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:36,780
We don't want documents
in system engineering.

1785
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,390
We just want to have
models that we share.

1786
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:43,010
But it's still moving
in that direction.

1787
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,600
OK, and then finally,
the point about system

1788
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,690
integration-- do not
just do it randomly.

1789
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:52,740
Think about, how will you
assemble the system physically?

1790
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:55,320
How are you going to connect
all your electronics,

1791
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,000
the consumables?

1792
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,460
How will you load your software?

1793
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,600
How will you test it?

1794
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,300
We'll talk about testing,
verification and validation

1795
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,050
next week, but the way
in which you integrate,

1796
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,750
the sequence of integration
could be very important.

1797
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,810
And it's a pretty
active area of research,

1798
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,760
so in sort of system
engineering research,

1799
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,040
is really understanding and
modeling system integration

1800
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,470
as something you can optimize.

1801
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:24,750
And then the last point
was industry standards.

1802
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,180
Really understand what
are the key standards

1803
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,460
in your industry, what are
the key interface standards.

1804
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:33,600
And if you're going
to deviate, if you're

1805
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,410
going to choose something else
than an industry standard,

1806
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,330
you better know why
you're doing it.

1807
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:42,450
Because the minute you
decide not to use an industry

1808
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:45,750
standard, you've probably
just inflated the cost

1809
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:49,170
by a factor of 10 because
now there's no longer

1810
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,780
any off-the-shelf components.

1811
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,800
You have to basically
do everything yourself,

1812
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:58,700
but it's possible that there's
good reasons for doing that.
