OLIVIER DE WECK: One of
the first assignments

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,300
that I ask students
to do in the class

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,010
is to write a team charter.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,330
Now what is a team charter?

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,470
You can think of a team
charter like a manifesto.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,860
It's essentially defining
the identity and the goals

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,960
that the team wants to pursue.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,990
And in this kind of class, there
could be many different goals.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,640
For example, as a team
you want to learn as much

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,610
as you can about the process of
systems engineering and design

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,110
and so forth.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,950
Another charter could be
that you are very ambitious

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,120
and you want to win
the competition.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
So you want to score
as high as you can.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,990
And the ultimate goal is to be
as highly ranked as possible

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,460
in the competition.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,400
Another goal could be just
to have fun, you know.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,490
To just have a good
time, to learn,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,800
but essentially to
really be together

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,320
in this learning
environment, to learn

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,310
and have fun at the same time.

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,080
And so the flavor of each team
is a little bit different.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,160
And rather than just letting
it happen without much thought

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,820
or discussion, the purpose of
the team charter or project

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,200
charter is to encourage
these discussions early,

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,410
such that the team
is on the same page

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,991
as they proceed
into the project.
