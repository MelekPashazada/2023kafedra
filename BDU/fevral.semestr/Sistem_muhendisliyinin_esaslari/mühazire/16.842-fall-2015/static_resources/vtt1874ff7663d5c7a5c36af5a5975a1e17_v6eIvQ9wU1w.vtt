00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:08.830
PROFESSOR: In order
to anchor the class,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.110
and provide an application
that is at the same time

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.260
realistic, but not
overly complex,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.810
we chose to participate in
the 2016 CANSAT competition.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.900
And CANSAT is just what
the name stands for.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.120
It's the design of
a satellite, that

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.730
fits into a can,
that is launched,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.130
not into space,
but at relatively

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.680
high altitude with a
sounding rocket, essentially.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.350
And so the CANSAT
competition has

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.510
been run for about 20 years.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.950
It's quite well
known, and there's

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.010
teams from all across the
world that participate.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.800
There is now a CANSAT
competition in the US.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.290
There's also a
European version of it.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.230
The goal of the
CANSAT competition,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.570
is for students
to go step by step

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.100
through the design process.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.630
The starting point
for the students,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.780
is a set of requirements,
47 requirements that

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.209
are given by the
organizers, about what

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.890
the particular system has to do.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.480
For example, the CANSAT has to
fit within the payload fairing

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.530
of the rocket.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.210
It has to survive the launch.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.510
So a certain number of
g loads and vibrations

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.060
have to be survivable
by the payload.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.420
The payload then has to
separate into both the glider

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.760
portion, and the
actual container that

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.290
contains the payload.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.460
On its way down, the payload has
to fly in a circular pattern,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.690
for about two minutes.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.660
And during the descent, it
has to record temperature

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.580
and pressure of the atmosphere.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.380
And you get extra
bonus points if you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.160
record images, and transmit
those images to the ground.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.230
The students who are
responsible for everything

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.010
except the rocket itself.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.750
So the design of the glider, the
container, the ground station,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.230
and all the procedures.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.000
So what's interesting about
systems engineering and design,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.650
is that there are
different approaches,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.300
how to tackle the problem.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.720
One is an approach where
you take it step by step,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.780
and you try to basically get
the right answer at every step.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.210
But, at some point you need
to check yourself, as well,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.200
with milestones.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.240
The other approach,
and that's typically

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.510
what we call a waterfall,
or stage gate process, which

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.810
is what's applied in very
large systems, where it's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.660
too expensive to do
a lot of prototypes,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.800
and you have to get it
right the first time.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520
The other approach is spiral
development, or agile,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.390
or rapid development, where
you do quick prototypes,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.047
and you learn very quickly,
and iterate your design.

00:02:36.047 --> 00:02:38.130
And in some sense, what
we're doing in this class,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.640
is a combination of the two.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.300
What was very
rewarding, is to see

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.980
how students ideated
their concepts, always

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.690
keeping in mind
the requirements,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.280
and the end goal in mind.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.940
But, also testing those
ideas, either through modeling

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.970
and simulation, or with
very simple prototypes that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.920
can be made out of paper.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.010
One team actually produced
a 3D printed version,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.960
of their glider, even
though that wasn't

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.550
officially necessary before
the key milestone, which

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.696
is the PDR.

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:11.070
And so it was
interesting to see,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.684
how every team approached
it slightly differently.
