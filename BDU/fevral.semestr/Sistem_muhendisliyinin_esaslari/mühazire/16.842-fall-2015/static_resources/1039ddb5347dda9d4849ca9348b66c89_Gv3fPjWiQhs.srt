1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,000
The personal reflective
memo is a two-page document

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,120
that I ask the students to
write at the end of the class

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,700
but before the oral exam.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,020
So all the lectures we've
had, all the team assignments,

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,600
and all the material
has been presented.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,390
And at this point,
this reflective memo

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,910
asks the students to think
back on the material.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,540
What really was the most
important thing they learned?

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,340
What of what they
learned in the class

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,900
are they going to build into
their own future projects,

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,710
their own careers?

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,010
If they're interested in systems
engineering as a career choice,

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,670
whether it's in research or in
industry, why is that the case?

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,820
And so they submit this one or
two days before the oral exam,

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,420
and so we have a chance to
read those reflective memos.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,910
And usually, one of the
very first questions

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,060
in the oral exam is
about some key ideas

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,099
that they presented
in their oral memo,

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,380
so it provides a great
hook into the oral exam.
