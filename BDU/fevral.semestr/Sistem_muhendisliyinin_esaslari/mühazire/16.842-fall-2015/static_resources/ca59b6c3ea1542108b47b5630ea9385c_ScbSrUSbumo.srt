8
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,300
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,100
So let's see.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,150
Mr. Sticky.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,740
Let's see, EPFL.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,130
Who picked Mr. Sticky?

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,840
Anybody?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,140
So the definition is a
cylindrical container

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,430
containing a date covered with
a [? basic ?] substance that

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,600
can be deployed in order to
attract and capture insects.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,710
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good.

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm glad you added the
last part because I

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,060
was worried that
you weren't going

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,920
to talk about the function.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,890
So it's good.

23
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,640
I think it's good.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
You started describing
the form, and then you

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,050
explained what the
function is at the end.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,030
So that's good.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,900
Anybody else do Mr. Sticky here?

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,780
Do you want to share?

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,310
AUDIENCE: So we said it
was a portable canister

31
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,730
deployable, fly-attracting
sticky tape,

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,202
fly-catching mechanism.

33
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,887
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

34
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,720
Yeah, I think you've
got the right elements.

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,140
I think it needs to
flow a little better,

36
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,480
but you've got the
right ingredients there.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,790
What about the i3.

38
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,950
Anybody?

39
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,651
Yeah, go ahead.

40
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:38,150
Justice.

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,775
AUDIENCE: You said
it was an efficiency

42
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:43,287
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

43
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,620
OLIVIER DE WECK: Say that again?

44
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,605
AUDIENCE: Can you turn
on the mic, please?

45
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:53,080
AUDIENCE: Does yours work?

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Do it again.

47
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,240
AUDIENCE: We said
it was an efficiency

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,640
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,480
OLIVIER DE WECK: Urban-optimized
transport vehicle.

50
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,275
I think it's good.

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,699
I think you're
missing the effect

52
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,500
that it's an all-electric, the
fact that it's fundamentally

53
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,840
an electric vehicle.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,185
I think it's key to the i3.

55
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:20,810
Because you have you
have other urban--

56
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,050
like the smart car.

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,640
And so architecturally,
distinguishing feature

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,300
is definitely the
electric drive.

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,090
So I think it's
good, but I think

60
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,610
you're just missing a little
bit on the technology there.

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,620
What about i3 and EPFL?

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,850
Anybody do the i3?

63
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,565
AUDIENCE: Nobody.

64
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,410
OLIVIER DE WECK: Nobody.

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,770
Anybody else here?

66
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,898
Yeah, Veronica.

67
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

68
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,600
Sorry.

69
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,200
A transportation system
responsible for moving people

70
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,240
and products with an
enclosed metal frame

71
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
equipped with various
safety devices

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
using electrically-powered
control and locomotion

73
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,912
subsystems.

74
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,800
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,760
That's pretty good.

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,120
There's a lot there.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,750
I would throw a question.

78
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,890
A concept you defined could
almost apply to a Tramway

79
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,660
as well.

80
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,419
If this was like a
streetcar, don't you

81
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,960
think it would apply
to that as well?

82
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,790
So I think the fact that
it's a personal vehicle,

83
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,410
I think it's important.

84
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,110
So the key in this is, describe
the concept using few words

85
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,930
precisely, but to set it apart
from neighboring concepts.

86
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,070
What about Rolex Center?

87
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,580
It's a single-layer
building with multiple straw

89
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,820
used as a library for
people to meet and study.

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,710
OLIVIER DE WECK: A single-story
building using multiple--

91
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,195
AUDIENCE: --floors.

92
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,360
OLIVIER DE WECK: Floors.

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,860
Oh, yeah.

94
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,620
So that's right.

95
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,710
AUDIENCE: You have one layer.

96
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,020
However, it has this wave
shape and therefore, you

97
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,370
have something
akin to two floors.

98
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,480
So the library is one
something like the upper floor

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,230
and the meeting areas, the
noisy areas on the lower floors.

100
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,019
So you can connect
both, but the noise

101
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,324
doesn't connect that easily.

102
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

103
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,340
No, that's very good, and I
think that's the architectural.

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,940
And then the library is there.

105
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,720
That's for sure?

106
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,510
But isn't there a lot of
other things or services

107
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,400
provided in that building
beyond the library?

108
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:41,360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have a bank,
a cafeteria, student services.

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,180
But you could encompass
it in a meeting area.

110
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,210
You meet and you do some stuff
like eating, going to the bank.

111
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,120
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,144
AUDIENCE: I think we
missed some functions.

113
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,060
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

114
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,540
So I like your
definition, but I think

115
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,130
by pointing out
the library, you're

116
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,980
missing the other functions.

117
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,080
And my understanding is that
the reason this was built

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,730
was to put two things.

119
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,130
One, is it's a focal point
for the community at EPFL.

120
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,480
We have a student
center here at MIT.

121
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,130
People go there to do their
banking, their eating,

122
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,550
their meeting, and so forth.

123
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,480
So in that sense,
it's pretty similar,

124
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,720
but I think the Rolex Center
is such an iconic building

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,640
that it also serve a kind
of a prestige function,

126
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,760
to put the institution
on the map in terms

127
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,040
of it's a statement.

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
It's not just a
utilitarian building.

129
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,790
Whereas, I would argue
our MIT student center,

130
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,250
it has very similar functions
to the Rolex Center,

131
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,630
but I wouldn't call
it an iconic building.

132
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,870
It doesn't have that wow factor.

133
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,000
Would you guys agree with that?

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,810
Yeah.

135
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe it did when it
was initially built.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,790
I'm not sure, but very good.

137
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,530
So we could spend a lot of time
on these, but really crisply

138
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,960
refining and thinking about the
concept is very, very important

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,050
So let me very quickly go
through the refrigerator case

140
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,000
study to show how do we
transition from concept

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,830
to design.

142
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,740
So the first thing you do is
understand where is the value--

143
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,250
the stakeholders
and the stakeholder

144
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,240
analysis and the
requirements definition.

145
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
And so in order to do that,
you ask the question, first

146
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,470
of all, value identification.

147
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,660
Where is the value?

148
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,120
And so you understand that
then who is the beneficiary?

149
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,470
That's a stakeholder.

150
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,200
The stakeholder has needs.

151
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,820
I'm using OPM here
to describe this.

152
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,640
And then this is a
funny thing here.

153
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,560
The needs have
these little bumps.

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,015
This is meant to
indicate a cloud.

155
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,680
This is not standard
OPM nomenclature.

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,010
Just point that out.

157
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,930
So this means that the
needs are somewhat vaporous.

158
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,120
They're not very well defined.

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
And then you interpret and
incorporate some of the needs

160
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,110
into goals, which
become requirements.

161
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,050
And so the goals then
are an instrument

162
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,710
of the primary delivery value
delivering process, which

163
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,510
is your value proposition.

164
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,370
To then actually
deliver that value

165
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,670
you need to design the product,
the product system, the product

166
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,680
object, and understand the
operand, the thing that

167
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
is being operated
on or transformed

168
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,740
by the primary value
delivery process.

169
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,360
That's a very abstract,
high-level way

170
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,350
to think about where's
the value in the system.

171
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,910
But fundamentally, this is part
of the reducing ambiguity work

172
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,800
that you do as a
system architect,

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
as a system engineer.

174
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
And there is a recipe
for doing this.

175
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,420
So first you start examining the
operand associated with value.

176
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,400
What's really the
thing that generates

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,790
the value that the user, the
beneficiaries care about.

178
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,130
Next you say, this is
the attribute link.

179
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,550
What attributes of the
upper are changing or being

180
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,070
affected associated with value?

181
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,160
And so the
attribute-transforming process

182
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,640
is where the value is generated.

183
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,760
So for food, I think we briefly
talked about this before.

184
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,180
Usually people will say, when
you think about a refrigerator,

185
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,830
keep the food cold.

186
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,309
But if you step back
and think about it

187
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,650
in a more abstract
way, it's really

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,010
about preserving
food or reducing

189
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,960
the spoilage rate of the food.

190
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,350
So the refrigerator
effectively becomes a food

191
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,010
spoilage rate reduction device.

192
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,380
and I know that sounds
terrible, but that

193
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,190
is really what it's about.

194
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,110
So when once you
think that way, you

195
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,620
can really start being creative
and focus your creativity.

196
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,440
So here we have the
food, and our goal

197
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,990
is to reduce its spoilage rate.

198
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,110
And then you can ask,
well, how can we do this?

199
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,690
What are all the
different ways of reducing

200
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,990
the spoilage rate of the food?

201
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,750
So from among the system
operating processes,

202
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,540
we then specialize and pick a
particular one for our concept.

203
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,020
So beside chilling or
keeping the food cold,

204
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,360
we could irradiate the food.

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,260
We could we dry the food.

206
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,890
What are some other ways that
we can reduce the spoilage rate?

207
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,010
So irradiating,
drying, chilling.

208
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,510
Sam?

209
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,402
AUDIENCE: Preserving.

210
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:45,568
OLIVIER DE WECK: Preserving.

211
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:48,440
So you add chemicals
essentially.

212
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,060
EPFL, how else can we do it?

213
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,290
Spoilage rate reduction?

214
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,574
AUDIENCE: Using chemicals?

215
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:56,490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

216
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,609
So that's chemical.

217
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,150
That's right.

218
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,110
What else?

219
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,600
Keep going.

220
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,700
Because food is pretty
essential for humans,

221
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,310
this is actually
one of the areas

222
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,260
where humans have
been very creative.

223
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,020
There's a lot of
ways to do this.

224
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,536
So keep going.

225
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:18,370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for example,
for conserving grapes,

226
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,730
maybe you do wine,
which is a process

227
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,590
to conserve this
wonderful [INAUDIBLE]..

228
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,670
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

229
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,532
Please keep some wine
for us too, please.

230
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,720
AUDIENCE: Beer is the same.

231
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,870
So marinating it,
vacuum packing, smoking,

233
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,070
on and on and on.

234
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,010
My favorite is
actually eating it.

235
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,120
What do bears do?

236
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,020
How do bears conserve food?

237
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,185
AUDIENCE: Fat.

238
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,060
OLIVIER DE WECK: Fat.

239
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,559
Right?

240
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,630
So bears, they actually
consume it and then

241
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,160
transform it into fat, into
a different storage form,

242
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,170
store it inside their
bodies, and then

243
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,710
as they hibernate,
that energy, that food

244
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,440
is being gradually consumed.

245
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,570
That's a very different
way, but it's essentially

246
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,200
the same function.

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,050
So that's the key idea is start
thinking in this abstract way,

248
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,310
and all of a sudden all
these other possibilities

249
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,950
become possible.

250
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,640
And that's really the cool part
about design and creativity.

251
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,460
But eventually, you have to
pick a particular concept.

252
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,195
So the chilling
part is not enough.

253
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,200
That's the function.

254
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
And then you say, well,
we need a chiller.

255
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,571
In order to chill,
we need a chiller,

256
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,320
and there are different
types of chillers,

257
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,450
like a cooler or refrigerator.

258
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,020
And it's the combination
of this specific way you're

259
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,330
going to operate the system.

260
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,390
The element of form and then
the specialized element of form,

261
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,840
in this case the
cooler, that combination

262
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,480
is what we call concept.

263
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,050
So once we have that, we can
start managing complexity,

264
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,070
decomposing function and form,
so our system operating process

265
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,820
gets decomposed into the
primary supporting processes

266
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,640
like interfacing,
powering, controlling.

267
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,400
And then our system object,
you can decompose it

268
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,280
into different elements,
supporting systems,

269
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,620
the operand, the
operator, and so forth.

270
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,910
And then we can start
connecting them.

271
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,900
So let's look at for
chilling the food,

272
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,510
let's look at a cooler
and a refrigerator

273
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,550
in terms of this decomposition.

274
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,040
So here's a picture of
a very simple cooler

275
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,020
that you would take
out on a picnic.

276
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,510
It has the chilling
function, and then

277
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,160
the sub-functions when we
zoom in are holding the food,

278
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,790
exchanging the heat between
the food and the environment,

279
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,520
reducing the heat load,
interfacing, connecting,

280
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,670
powering, regulating the
temperature, et cetera.

281
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,010
And then on the form
side, the cooler

282
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,560
itself is very
simple structurally.

283
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,590
It just has a bottom, a box
with a bottom and a top.

284
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,250
And then we have the
ice, the food supporting

285
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,550
the surface, the external
heat load, ambient light,

286
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,010
and the operator.

287
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,560
What's surprising here
is when you map the two,

288
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,530
there's a surprising
amount of complexity.

289
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,110
It's not a very clear
one-to-one mapping.

290
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,700
Let's just look at the ice.

291
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,420
So here's the ice, and you can
just follow these links to see

292
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,800
what functions, sub-functions
does the ice support--

293
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,740
exchanging heat, powering,
and regulating temperature.

294
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,040
So exchanging heat
means, essentially,

295
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,290
the ice itself acts
as a heat exchanger.

296
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,360
Just the surface
of the ice is where

297
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,700
the heat exchange happens.

298
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,210
So what forms can you
put ice into a cooler?

299
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,046
What are the different
shapes of ice

300
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,420
that you could
put into a cooler?

301
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,470
AUDIENCE: Like an ice pack.

302
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,150
OLIVIER DE WECK: You
could put ice pack

303
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,070
or you could put
a block or chips.

304
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,090
And if you put the
same quantity of ice,

305
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,190
but you put a block of
ice, you put little chips,

306
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,660
what will be the difference?

307
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
Will there be a difference?

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,290
Surface area, right?

309
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,350
So the speed at
which the ice will

310
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,290
melt for the same given
external temperature

311
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,410
is going to be different.

312
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,630
So there's an attribute of
the ice, which is essentially

313
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,290
its quantity, but also it's
form that will influence the--

314
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,780
but that's the heat
exchanger function.

315
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,140
The powering function
is pretty clear.

316
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,240
That's essentially the
energy storage right there.

317
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,450
And then the third
one is regulation.

318
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,140
How does that work?

319
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,057
How does the ice provide
a thermal regulation

320
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:02,640
in the cooler?

321
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,650
Physics 101.

322
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,602
Yeah?

323
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,976
Go ahead.

324
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:11,852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

325
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:12,810
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

326
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,960
So as long as you have any
ice left in the cooler,

327
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,540
what will be the
temperature inside?

328
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,880
Not opening and
closing, but if you

329
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,530
keep it closed, what will be
the temperature in the cooler?

330
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,726
AUDIENCE: 0 Celsius.

331
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:25,850
OLIVIER DE WECK: 0 Celsius.

332
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,620
As long as you
have ice left, this

333
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,400
is the phase transformation,
you're at that point.

334
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,020
As soon as the ice
is all melting,

335
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,400
the temperature will rise.

336
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,230
So the phase transformation of
the ice from solid to liquid

337
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,330
is what, in fact,
is the regulation

338
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,010
mechanism inside the cooler.

339
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,470
So even though you
think of a cooler

340
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,590
as being something super
simple and trivial,

341
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,720
once you start listing
its internal functions

342
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,370
and how the top, the
bottom the ice itself,

343
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,030
how they interact and
support those functions,

344
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,340
it's pretty complex.

345
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,140
And you can go
very detailed here,

346
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,499
even for something very
simple like a cooler.

347
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,790
One question and then we'll
talk about the refrigerator

348
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,690
and how it's
different in a minute.

349
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,380
One question I
often get is what's

350
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,000
the difference between system
architecting and system design?

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,310
Isn't that the same thing?

352
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,400
And I think they're
somewhat different.

353
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,100
They're overlapping, but
there's a distinction.

354
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,630
So architecture selects the
concept, the decomposition,

355
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,970
mapping of function to form.

356
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,490
And architecture
essentially establishes

357
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,040
the vector of design variables.

358
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,950
What are the key design
variables and operating

359
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,110
parameters of the system?

360
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,690
Design, then, given that,
selects the actual values

361
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,350
for those design variables,
and then you can optimize.

362
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,280
So if we look at the
example of the cooler here,

363
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,840
we have our cooler with the box
in the bottom and then the ice,

364
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,540
and we can decompose
the attributes of that.

365
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,250
So the box with bottom
has length with height.

366
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,380
It has a wall thickness.

367
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,750
It has a type of material.

368
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,180
The top has thickness
and material,

369
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,099
and the ice, like we
just talked about,

370
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,020
has quantity, surface area, and
maybe initial water content.

371
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,760
And those are the
operating parameters,

372
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,119
and on the upper right, those
are the design variables.

373
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,490
So when you are making
a material choice,

374
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,040
we're going to use PVC.

375
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,970
We're going to have a
2.1-inch thick wall.

376
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,840
We're going to use
this much insulation.

377
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,950
This will be the aspect
ratio of the cooler.

378
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,010
It's going to have wheels
maybe, so we can pull it easily.

379
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,560
Those are essentially
design decisions.

380
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,760
You're instantiating
that concept.

381
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,940
But the fact that it
has a bottom and a top

382
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,390
and it's hinged and
it uses this phase

383
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,690
transition as the
regulation mechanism,

384
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,920
that's conceptual design.

385
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,840
That's system architecture,
and you need to do both.

386
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,130
But they're not quite the same.

387
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,370
Is that pretty clear?

388
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,000
That's a very
important distinction.

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So let's look at
the form function

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,430
mapping for refrigerators.

391
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,590
So this is actually
a big difference

392
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,390
between the US and Switzerland.

393
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,870
People in the US, we like
to have big refrigerators,

394
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,990
big gallon of milk, and
refrigerators in Switzerland

395
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,370
are much smaller.

396
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,310
I'm not sure why.

397
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,450
Maybe you go
shopping more often,

398
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,880
but it's definitely one
of the big differences.

399
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,170
But here we have essentially
the decomposition

400
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,400
of the refrigerator.

401
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
So we have racks.

402
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,710
We have the air.

403
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,020
We have-- I guess
freon is banned now,

404
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,660
so we should use some other.

405
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,710
This is a refrigerant, a
working fluid, the insulation,

406
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,340
the feet and rollers, the frame,
the electric motor, sensors,

407
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,114
controller doors, lights.

408
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,030
And then we have those
functions, essentially,

409
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,420
the same functions we had for
the cooler, holding the food,

410
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,590
exchanging the heat,
powering, regulating.

411
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,230
But the difference is
that we have much more

412
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,740
of a one-to-one mapping.

413
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,220
So in the refrigerator,
each of these elements

414
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,180
supports, essentially, one
of the primary sub-functions.

415
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,750
So the form function
mapping in the refrigerator

416
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,860
is actually much simpler.

417
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,650
It's a much simpler
form function

418
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,480
mapping than the cooler.

419
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,300
And you say, well, I thought
a refrigerator is much more

420
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,410
complex.

421
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,770
How can that be?

422
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,370
Well, the real complexity
comes in when you

423
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,220
look at the form form mapping.

424
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,010
So this is then
the decomposition

425
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,365
of the refrigerator in terms
of all the elements of form

426
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,990
and then how they
relate to each other.

427
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,380
And I'm not showing here
all the sub-processes,

428
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,280
but you can see that the
mapping and the relationships

429
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,930
are much more complex than
in the case of the cooler.

430
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:01,640
So to wrap up on this piece,
when we do a conceptual design

431
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,950
or system architecture, you
have two major activities.

432
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,370
One is concept generation.

433
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,850
So take the requirements
and think creatively

434
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,430
about how these requirements
could be fulfilled.

435
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,950
So that means
understanding the operand,

436
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,730
the attribute of the operand
that you're trying to affect--

437
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,960
it could be multiple here--

438
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,660
the intent attribute--
this means the required,

439
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,250
desired state--

440
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,590
what is the system
operating process,

441
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,020
and what is your
major element of form.

442
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,110
So that's generating this
and specializing that.

443
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,660
That's concept generation,
finding systems

444
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,520
that do the right thing.

445
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,447
And then once you
have several concepts,

446
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,030
you've got to select
among them, which

447
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,440
we'll talk about next week.

448
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,230
That's our topic next
week is concept selection.

449
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,510
So finding systems
that do the right thing

450
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,890
and do it well, deliver value,
and comply with regulations,

451
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,220
standards, and so forth.

452
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,000
So there's going to be
consumables involved,

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,710
side effects, like noise,
waste heat, pollution.

454
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,650
The operator, how skilled
does the operator has to be

455
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,820
or how autonomous is the system.

456
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,130
What is the reliability,
safety, cost, the quantity.

457
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,270
All those things are
describing the concept

458
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,640
and its instantiation
in more detail

459
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,580
and will help you do
concept selection.

460
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Do you do you see
the difference?

461
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,430
Concept generation is
take the requirements

462
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,110
and come up with the fundamental
form function mapping of how

463
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,100
the requirements can be met.

464
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,870
Then you instantiate
that in terms of designs

465
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,050
and then you can evaluate
those and compare concepts

466
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,020
using other criteria
like consumables,

467
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,060
quantity, how skilled does the
operator have to be, et cetera.

468
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,920
So those are fundamentally
different activities.

469
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,050
So let me summarize
on system architecture

470
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,850
and then talk about the NASA
approach and then creativity.

471
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,250
So architecture
requires consideration

472
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,160
of both function and form
related through concept.

473
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,770
It's about starting
with the operand.

474
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,710
What is the thing that the
beneficiary, the stakeholder

475
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,670
cares about, and how
do we transform that?

476
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,640
Concept then elaborate
these into architectures

477
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,370
that have form function
and structural complexity.

478
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,290
And then the goodness
of an architecture

479
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,900
is really a pretty
complex concept

480
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,750
where we have multiple
objectives to satisfy,

481
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,860
including performance, resource
utilization, cost, operability,

482
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,810
safety, capacity, and so forth.

483
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,100
And we'll defer
that to next week.

484
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,280
So let me briefly talk about
the NASA approach to this

485
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,500
and then talk about
some methods and tools

486
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,900
for concept generation.

487
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,810
So the NASA approach
is basically

488
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,340
described in the
system engineering

489
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,520
handbook in the SE
engine as step 3

490
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,410
called logical decomposition.

491
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,590
And so the logical
decomposition process,

492
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,570
as described in
the NASA standard,

493
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,550
is used to improve
the understanding

494
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,580
of the technical requirements
and the relationship

495
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,920
among those, transforming that
initial set of requirements

496
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,200
into a decomposition.

497
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,410
So the idea that we need
to partition the system

498
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,500
and then derive lower-level
technical requirements based

499
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,860
on that lower-level
definition, and that's what's

500
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,010
called architecting.

501
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,670
Getting back to our high-level
system design process,

502
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,620
this is, again, that
diagram that we've looked

503
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,200
at several times already.

504
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,450
You can see the red box
is where this happened.

505
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,020
So we started with mission
authority, stakeholder

506
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,930
expectation, and then defining
those high-level requirements.

507
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,890
Level 0, level 1 requirements,
but then you get stuck.

508
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,650
You get stuck because you
have to make some decisions

509
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,010
before you can go to lower
level requirements definition.

510
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,590
And that's what's known here
as functional and logical

511
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,030
decomposition.

512
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,130
Once you've decided
on a composition

513
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,130
and you can carry several
compositions with you

514
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,990
for a while, then you can do
the lower-level trade studies,

515
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,410
derive and allocate
lower-level requirements refine

516
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,450
your CONOPS, and so forth.

517
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,880
And then do functional
and performance analysis

518
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,090
to see whether you
have enough detail.

519
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,020
Is it workable?

520
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,780
Is it safe?

521
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,120
Is it reliable?

522
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,020
And if yes, then you can select
that as a baseline, if not,

523
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,140
you might have to go back
to the red box, which means

524
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,760
that architecture didn't work.

525
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,710
We have to look for a
different decomposition

526
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,270
or different architecture.

527
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,210
And if that doesn't work after
multiple iterations here,

528
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,174
you might have to go back
and change the requirements,

529
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,590
because you come
to the conclusion

530
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,590
that the requirements are
not really achievable.

531
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,000
So some examples here
of decomposition models,

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,030
here's a timing diagram.

533
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,100
On the right side, you
have a state diagram,

534
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,560
the different states that
the system can be in.

535
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,190
So you can see this relates very
strongly to the system modeling

536
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,810
languages that we talked about.

537
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,940
So you use the system
modeling languages

538
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,360
to decompose and define
the system in more detail.

539
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,680
And we really talked about
much of this already.

540
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,820
And in terms of the logical
decomposition flow diagram,

541
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,360
you start with your basic
high-level requirements

542
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,980
and measures of performance.

543
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,040
You essentially do
your decomposition.

544
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,430
And then on the right side, you
come out with the lower-level

545
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,330
derived technical requirements,
logical decomposition models,

546
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,070
which would be
essentially a description

547
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,350
of your different subsystems
and the logical decomposition

548
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,370
work products, which are
essentially lower-level

549
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,040
definitions of what these
subsystems look like.

550
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,190
And then you can go off and do
the detailed design and then

551
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,930
the testing verification
and so forth.

552
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,060
So it's essentially
focused on decomposition,

553
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,700
which is an important
part of architecting,

554
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,600
but it's not the
only thing you do.

555
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,880
So let me talk about methods and
tools for concept generation.

556
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,241
So I'm going to start with this.

557
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:10,270
This is another really fun
thing we do in the system design

558
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,090
and management program,
which is a full-year program,

559
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,030
is the we call it the
creativity workshop.

560
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,010
So what are different ways
of stimulating or organizing

561
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,790
creativity.

562
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,370
And what I'm showing
you here is--

563
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,500
that's essentially a
mind map of how to think

564
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,690
about the creativity space.

565
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,630
So I'll briefly go through
this, and then we'll

566
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,170
look at a couple of examples.

567
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:39,100
So one idea is that
creativity is better

568
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,310
if it's a group process, that
people stimulate each other.

569
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,840
And so this whole group up
there is called group dynamics.

570
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,400
These are all different methods
for stimulating creativity

571
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,640
using groups of people.

572
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,010
And some of these are
authors that have written

573
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,840
and methods, so de Bono, Six
Hats, powwows, mind boggling,

574
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,390
workouts, creativity
workouts, these

575
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,080
are all different variations
of group dynamic processes.

576
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
The one that I'll talk
about in some more detail

577
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,980
is brainstorming.

578
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,990
This is probably the best known.

579
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,090
What's not so much known
about brainstorming

580
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,030
is that there's a
right way to do it.

581
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,720
On the upper right
branch, creativity

582
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,590
and system architecture,
this is just

583
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,500
describing the importance of
it, the three themes we talked

584
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,440
about-- creativity,
ambiguity, complexity,

585
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,850
different types of innovation,
radical innovation, modular,

586
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,760
or incremental innovation, and
so forth, and the high leverage

587
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
that it has.

588
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,800
The next branch are called
models of creativity.

589
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,660
What that essentially
means, and I'll

590
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,990
give you one example here,
which is Leonardo da Vinci,

591
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,110
is understanding
people that universally

592
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,880
are claimed as having been
very creative thinkers.

593
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
Why were they creative?

594
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,980
What was their
recipe for success?

595
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,470
Below that, we have
structured processes,

596
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,850
which are essentially trying to
organize the creativity, which

597
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,760
seems like an oxymoron,
but there are actually

598
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,520
ways to have a
structured process

599
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,620
to stimulate concept generation.

600
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,590
And we'll talk about very
briefly mind mapping and then

601
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,720
morphological matrices.

602
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,330
And then we have
this whole area here,

603
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,240
which I'm going to
mention, but we're not

604
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,050
going to do as part of the
class, which is stimulants.

605
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,050
So this is the idea
that somehow people

606
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:38,040
are more creative when
their brain, when you put

607
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,260
yourself into some other state.

608
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,110
So bio-inspired design
would be you go in nature,

609
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,930
or you read books about
seashells and animals and you

610
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,900
really try to
understand from nature--

611
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,750
and bio-inspired design
is a very important field

612
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,970
of research now.

613
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,890
It's pretty serious.

614
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,230
So you put yourself
in nature and be

615
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,200
inspired by what you see.

616
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,300
Random inputs, provocations,
challenges, and then things

617
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,510
like alcohol, and even drugs.

618
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,050
So a lot of the music that
was done in the hippie age

619
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,530
in the '60s, I mean,
a lot of these artists

620
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,900
were consuming large amounts
of drugs and alcohol.

621
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,160
And there's a big discussion
on is this fundamentally

622
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,510
why they were creative.

623
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,400
So I'm not advocating that.

624
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm just I'm just
telling you that there

625
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,090
is this idea that you
can stimulate creativity

626
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,080
in these different ways.

627
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,500
So let's talk
about mind mapping.

628
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,550
So this is an example of a
mind map that I really liked.

629
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,220
This is from several years ago.

630
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,330
This is from a student that took
the system architecture class.

631
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,000
And so the idea of a mind map
is that you look inside yourself

632
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,250
and you try to put down on a map
different ideas and concepts.

633
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,960
So in the core of it, you
have the key focal point

634
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,950
of the mind map.

635
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,680
In this case, it's
system architecture,

636
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,020
and then you have these
branches coming off.

637
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:22,050
So the class itself, the skills,
the concepts, the themes,

638
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,930
and then it almost looks
like a neural network.

639
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,040
You branch off into the
sub ideas and sub concept.

640
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,680
And in order to really
make it memorable,

641
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,750
you draw it by hand
even though there

642
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,100
is software for doing this.

643
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,110
But I really like this, drawing
it by hand the old style.

644
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,490
And then you add icons
and symbols and colors

645
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,700
to really make this
sticky and memorable.

646
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,770
So you can look at that.

647
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,660
I really like this example.

648
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,500
And it probably takes
a couple of hours

649
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,390
to do a really good
mind map like this.

650
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,340
But the idea is
that by doing this,

651
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,800
you're going to develop
your ideas and concepts.

652
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,080
And there's books
about mind mapping.

653
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,010
I mean, it's a whole
industry almost.

654
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,570
Brainstorming.

655
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,480
So by the way, who
has done brainstorming

656
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,630
and organized brainstorming?

657
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,550
Who's been part of a
brainstorming exercise?

658
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,980
Do you want to describe
it, how that worked?

659
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,422
Make sure you use the mic.

660
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:30,150
AUDIENCE: So we started
with our problem,

661
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,467
and if I remember it right, it
was to redesign a coffee mug.

662
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:37,050
OLIVIER DE WECK:
This was for a class?

663
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

664
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:44,910
And then basically, for the
first part, any idea could go.

665
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,390
And the only role
was you couldn't

666
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,140
criticize anyone else's idea.

667
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,290
So he basically tried to come
up with as much as we could,

668
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,859
wrote as much as we
could on the board,

669
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:58,900
things along those lines.

670
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,652
And then once we had
all of our ideas down

671
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,110
and some people built off of
other ones and then it was oh,

672
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,170
but we can also add this.

673
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,770
And then we started
to look at well,

674
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,990
we can't really believe that.

675
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,550
This is going to be
way too expensive

676
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,830
and started down
selecting from there.

677
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,800
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did you take
a break between the two parts?

678
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

679
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,490
OLIVIER DE WECK: So yeah,
you described it very well.

680
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,600
So the key idea is
there's some rules for how

681
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,540
to properly do brainstorming,
and some of them

682
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,400
are listed here.

683
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,150
And then I have another
on the next chart,

684
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,130
there's sort of a step by step.

685
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,910
So it's really try to
remove creativity barriers,

686
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,470
stimulate each other.

687
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,830
There's an ideal group size,
and it says 5 to 10 here,

688
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,950
but I should probably
revise this to be--

689
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,810
what do you think?

690
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,050
7 plus minus 2.

691
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,380
If you try to do brainstorming
session with 30 people

692
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,260
in the room, it's too big.

693
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,720
It's not going to
be that productive.

694
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,730
So use of intuition,
associations.

695
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,140
What's important
is that you have

696
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,940
a clear idea of why you're
doing the brainstorming session.

697
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,730
So there's some solution
neutral question,

698
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,370
like how can we
improve a coffee mug.

699
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,620
What did you come up with,
by the way, at the end?

700
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,187
Did you have a result?

701
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:19,770
AUDIENCE: I think
it was we were going

702
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,410
to redesign the handle so
it would be more ergonomic.

703
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,160
But, yeah.

704
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,610
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what can be
done too, how can we improve.

705
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,880
There's got to be a driving
question for the brainstorming

706
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,649
session.

707
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,440
Actually, the first
time this was described

708
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,230
was by AF Osborn in
this book in 1957.

709
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,840
There's why is
brainstorming useful.

710
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,030
We can talk about that.

711
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,460
A lot of it has to do
with this group dynamics.

712
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,920
How to organize and host
a brainstorming session.

713
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,510
I'll talk about that next.

714
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,300
And then there's this killer
sentences you should never

715
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,560
say during a brainstorming.

716
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,330
Some of these are pretty funny.

717
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,910
And then what do you
do with the results.

718
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,430
How do you actually then take
the brainstorming results

719
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,850
and use them for further
refining or down-selecting

720
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,350
concepts.

721
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,810
So here's a six-step process for
doing a brainstorming session.

722
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:21,280
So you send out invitations
a few days ahead of time.

723
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,840
And the idea is that people
can think about this question

724
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,300
so that when they come to
the brainstorming session,

725
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,730
their brain is
preloaded with ideas.

726
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,780
That's the idea.

727
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,380
You don't just pull people
in like five minutes earlier.

728
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,230
The idea is give a
few days, not weeks,

729
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,480
but a few days of
warning so that people

730
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,770
can think about this and come to
the brainstorming session ready

731
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,179
and charged to
share their ideas.

732
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,489
7 plus or minus 2 participants.

733
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,020
There should be a facilitator.

734
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,590
This is somebody who
is helping to moderate.

735
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,720
Participants take turns
expressing thoughts,

736
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,000
suggestions, ideas.

737
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,410
You should take notes.

738
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,560
So for example, these big
whiteboards are great for that,

739
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,200
with idea paint, the whole wall.

740
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,130
That's great.

741
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,390
Or you can do flip charts.

742
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,420
You can do different ways
of capturing these ideas.

743
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,100
And then I think
you mentioned this.

744
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,580
It's called the principle
of delayed judgment.

745
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,730
So you're not
allowed to criticize

746
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,740
or particularly praise.

747
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,400
So you could, for
example say, oh,

748
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,170
this is the best idea we've
had so far in this session.

749
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,140
Even though it's praise,
it actually implicitly is

750
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,610
criticism of the other ideas.

751
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,720
So avoid that.

752
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,490
Avoid the killer phrases.

753
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,060
And then the idea there
is produce a large amount

754
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,730
and diversity of ideas.

755
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,000
And then at some point, maybe
30 to 60 minutes, you end.

756
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,750
Brainstorming session
that last four hours,

757
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,330
the first hour is
probably really good

758
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,760
and then the second hour
OK, and then the rest

759
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,850
is everybody is kind of
shot and, there's not

760
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,470
a lot of new ideas coming.

761
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,540
Creativity killer sentences.

762
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,680
I highlighted a few.

763
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,870
This will never work.

764
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,980
We don't even need
to talk about this.

765
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,990
Everybody does it this way.

766
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,710
I've already studied
this problem for years.

767
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,680
Don't worry, I know I'm
right, and et cetera.

768
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,700
How long have you been
with this company?

769
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,760
Anyway, so that's the idea.

770
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,710
All right Leonardo.

771
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,970
Who's been to Italy
or tour in France,

772
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,830
or who's seen one
of the exhibits

773
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,066
know where his notebooks
are on display?

774
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,326
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

775
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,290
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

776
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,470
What about EPFL?

777
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,550
Have you guys seen
these wandering exhibits

778
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,710
about Leonardo's work
and his notebooks?

779
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,130
Anybody had a
chance to see that?

780
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,480
Go ahead.

781
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

782
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,510
Actually, he do a lot of sketch,
and he [INAUDIBLE] the fact

783
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,344
that sketching is more
important than writing.

784
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:05,260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

785
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,960
That's right.

786
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,900
So really, he didn't
build a lot of his ideas.

787
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,470
So that's one of the--
did he actually then.

788
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,330
But he was a head of
his time in many ways.

789
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,870
So he's really been identified
as an exceptional individual.

790
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,740
So here's a book called How
to Think Like Leonardo, Seven

791
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,330
Steps to Genius.

792
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,920
And I'm not a big fan
of these popular books,

793
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,040
but this one is
pretty interesting

794
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,025
because what's been
extracted from this

795
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:37,020
is the seven da Vincian
principles of creativity.

796
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,302
And they're here in Italian.

797
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm just going to go
through them very quickly.

798
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,220
So curiosita, lifelong
quest for learning.

799
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,150
Dimostratzione, testing your
knowledge through experience,

800
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,740
trying things out.

801
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,680
Sensazione, continual
refinement of the senses.

802
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,750
Sfumato, which is essentially
also a style of painting,

803
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,860
like the Mona Lisa is
painted in sfumato style.

804
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,080
Mastering ambiguity,
paradox, uncertainty.

805
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,190
Arte/Scienza is the whole brain
thinking, left-right brain.

806
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,650
Corporalita, balance of body
and mind, so a healthy mind

807
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,330
and a healthy body.

808
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,280
And then connessione
is interesting.

809
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,740
That gets close to system
architecture, which

810
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,060
is the appreciation of patterns,
relationships, connections,

811
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,470
and systems.

812
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,100
So the idea is that,
this from Leonardo,

813
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,280
his work, his way of thinking,
these seven principles

814
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,240
have been extracted.

815
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,730
And then you can say,
well, which of these

816
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,490
do I feel really
resonate with me?

817
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:42,990
All right.

818
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,700
So we have only a
few minutes left.

819
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,320
Let's move to some of
the structured processes

820
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,604
for creativity.

821
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:52,020
So the first one
I want to mention

822
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,810
is this is probably the
simplest and the one that's

823
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,860
used the most.

824
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,050
This is known as a
morphological matrix.

825
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,130
So the idea there
is that you try

826
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,420
to define what are the key
features, factors, or decisions

827
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,250
that you have to
make when you define

828
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,380
a concept or an architecture.

829
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,860
So the key decisions
are the rows.

830
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,080
Let's say there's
n key decisions.

831
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
There are factors in the rows.

832
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,370
And then for each row
you think about what

833
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:25,500
are the number of possible
alternatives for doing this.

834
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,020
And then you enumerate
all possible combinations.

835
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,050
So an example here
would be here's

836
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,560
our morphological matrix.

837
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:42,360
And then one possible concept
here would be A2, B1, C3.

838
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,130
That's our concept here.

839
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,330
And then you can see that for
a full-factorial enumeration,

840
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,670
you would have 27 architectures
that you could generate.

841
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,460
So the number of
architectures here

842
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,590
is 27, based on this
morphological matrix.

843
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,310
And I find this to be
very, very helpful.

844
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,710
When the table gets
too big, very quickly

845
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,700
because of this being a product,
this can really explode on you.

846
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,350
It can be very large.

847
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,480
And the big challenge
with this, of course,

848
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,650
is if you have many factors, you
could generate many infeasible

849
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,400
architectures.

850
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,190
Not all these combinations
are actually feasible.

851
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,520
So the question then is,
how do you prevent that,

852
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,780
and that's where so-called
architecture enumeration comes

853
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,740
in.

854
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,750
And I'm not going to go
in a lot of detail here.

855
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,160
But the idea is that through
creativity, expert knowledge,

856
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,550
and analysis you're going to
define your components, which

857
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,910
are essentially the rows in
the morphological matrix.

858
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,570
But you're also going to
establish rules that tell you

859
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,600
which combinations are
actually valid combinations

860
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,950
and which ones are not.

861
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,290
And that, in fact,
is [? Narek's ?] PhD

862
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:56,310
topic is, how do you
increase the number

863
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:01,150
of physics-based rules rather
than just empirical rules.

864
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,400
Because if you think about it.

865
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,410
If you apply rules that are
just based on current practice,

866
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,000
then you're just
going to recreate

867
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,280
concepts and architectures
we already have.

868
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,100
You won't really come up with
something fundamentally new

869
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,260
because you've constrained
the combinations

870
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,570
to what people do now.

871
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,900
So the real challenge here
is, between generating

872
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,240
all possible combinations,
many of which

873
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,760
are infeasible and only the
ones that we currently have,

874
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,530
there's a middle ground there.

875
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,020
So that's architecture
enumeration,

876
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,090
and there's different
ways of doing this

877
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,380
at different layers
of abstraction.

878
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,780
So here's an example
of airplanes,

879
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,640
different configurations
of airplanes.

880
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,190
If you think about
the tail of airplanes,

881
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:54,270
we have the traditional tail
with a lower stabilizer.

882
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,350
We have T tails.

883
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,100
We have we have V tails.

884
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,350
I mean, there's like 12
different tail geometries here.

885
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,800
And you could think of this for
the wings, for the fuselage,

886
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,300
for the engine
locations, very quickly,

887
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,310
you can generate thousands or
even millions of architectures.

888
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,120
But at that higher abstraction
layer, it's just a single tail.

889
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,190
So how do you combine these
using compositional rules?

890
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,130
That's architecture enumeration.

891
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,510
So here's also an example
from [? Narek's ?] work.

892
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,350
So at an engine, a
turbo prop engine

893
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,390
at a high level of
abstraction, that's

894
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,810
basically a propeller,
an intake, a core,

895
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,250
and a core nozzle.

896
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,310
And then to break that concept
in further detail, the core

897
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,490
itself gets shown at a
lower level of detail.

898
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,170
And you can see that
inside the core,

899
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,470
you have, in this case, a single
compressor, a burner, and then

900
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,290
a turbine that drives
the compressor.

901
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,590
And so one of the
advances in engines

902
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:03,420
has been from World War II to go
from single-stage to two-stage,

903
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,230
thee-stage engines,
and so forth.

904
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,350
So the complexity
has been going up,

905
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,710
but you can actually generate
through architectural

906
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,370
enumeration, essentially,
all architectures

907
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,500
that have been built
and that are known

908
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,430
and have been certified through
a organized architecture

909
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,590
enumeration process.

910
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,330
Some of this can
be done in Excel,

911
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,640
for example, where
you essentially

912
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,790
list your components.

913
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,670
This is your library
of components.

914
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,470
And then on a
different sheet, you

915
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,750
define all the
different rules that

916
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,690
allow you to combine
different number of instances

917
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,030
of these components
into architectures.

918
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,850
And we'll post some
information on this

919
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,220
if you want to try this
out for your concepts.

920
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,170
So let me summarize.

921
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,520
So system architecture is
definitely very abstract,

922
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,679
but it's also, potentially,
the most influential activity

923
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,095
that we do in
system architecting.

924
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:01,290
The concept is mapping
function to form.

925
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,360
We typically, in the
conceptual design,

926
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,840
don't do all the details.

927
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,490
We just go down two
levels of abstraction.

928
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,930
So not all the
details are defined.

929
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,130
The NASA approach
specify or is really

930
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,800
focused on this idea of
logical decomposition, which

931
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,370
is very important, but
it's not the only thing

932
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,170
we do in system architecture.

933
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,840
And then the really cool
part, the exciting part

934
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,270
in concept generation is
the one that it's really

935
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,700
a creative activity.

936
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,230
And when you look at the set
of creativity techniques,

937
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,080
you can think of group dynamics
like the brainstorming.

938
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,140
That's used very
heavily, but you

939
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,820
have to do it the right way.

940
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,740
If you organize a
brainstorming session,

941
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,790
and there's some wiggle
room, but if you violate

942
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,040
some fundamental principles
of brainstorming,

943
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,680
you're not going to
get the full benefit.

944
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,400
Models.

945
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,820
So thinking about really
creative individuals

946
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,970
and what drove them, what
were their principles,

947
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,100
and try to emulate some of that.

948
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,660
And then the
structured processes,

949
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,420
which include mind maps,
morphological matrices,

950
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,710
and then architecture
enumeration.

951
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,700
So when you look at
assignment A3, which is now

952
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,700
out there, that's
really what it is about,

953
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,630
is you've done the stakeholder
analysis and initial CONOPS,

954
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,980
you have a requirements set.

955
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,050
So now be unchained, and
within the constraints

956
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,480
that are set by the
competition, come up

957
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,950
with different concepts.

958
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,450
And in the homework, what
I ask you to do in A3

959
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,420
is try out at least two
different techniques,

960
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,670
a structured one and
an unstructured one

961
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,890
and then compare the results.

962
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,940
And this will be
due in two weeks.
